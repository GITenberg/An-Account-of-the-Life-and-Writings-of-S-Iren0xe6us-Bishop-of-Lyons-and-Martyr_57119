        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was, perhaps,
        somewhat presumptuous in a person occupying so humble a station in
        the sacred ministry to offer to the Church a work which would
        necessarily induce comparisons between itself and the similar
        productions of a Prelate of the Church—a Divine of the highest rank
        and character. The author can, however, at least say, that it was no
        foolish ambition which led to his employing himself on such a work.
        Having been led by circumstances to a repeated perusal and study of
        the writings of S. Irenæus, he saw the great value of his testimony
        to the leading principles and doctrines of the Church of England. He
        had himself derived much benefit from the works of Bishop Kaye on
        others of the Fathers; he thought that if he could do nothing more
        than to draw out the substance of the doctrine and opinions of
        Irenæus for the use of the student in theology, in a more accessible
        form than that in which he himself had to look for it, accompanied by
        the text of the portions from which he had formed his statements,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id=
        "Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and with a little illustration of
        the meaning in passages liable to misunderstanding,—he should have
        rendered a service to his younger brethren: and if it should so
        happen that that distinguished Prelate or any other writer did
        anticipate him, it would be so much clear gain to himself to have
        been so employed. When he had completed his first preparations, and
        had learnt by proper inquiry that the Illustrator of Justin, Clement,
        and Tertullian was not engaged on Irenæus, he endeavoured to put the
        work somewhat into form: and being afterwards encouraged by one upon
        whose judgment and acquirements public opinion had set its stamp, and
        who had seen portions of the work, to believe that it possessed a
        certain degree of value,—he ventured to bring it into public notice
        in the only way which appeared open to him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He desires here to
        record his sense of the most kind and most hearty encouragement he
        has met with from persons of all ranks and classes, capable of
        appreciating a work of this description, or of aiding in its
        publication: more especially of that afforded him by her Majesty
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The
        Queen Dowager</span></span>, by the Most Reverend and Right Reverend
        Prelates who have honoured him with their support, by the many
        persons distinguished either for station or for literary eminence,
        whose names will be found in the subjoined list, and by the
        warm-hearted friends, both of the clergy and of the laity, with whom
        he is either locally or personally connected.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His work, such as
        it is, he now sends forth, trusting that, through the blessing of the
        Divine <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">Head</span></span> of the Church, it may
        be available to the great ends of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagevii">[pg vii]</span><a name="Pgvii" id="Pgvii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> ministry to which he has been called, and may
        tend to the unity, the strength, and the stability of the Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before, however,
        he takes his leave of his readers, he wishes to add a few words on
        the Right Use of the Writings of the Fathers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. We use them as
        we do the writings of secular authors, to ascertain the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">facts</span></em> of
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">history</span></em> of their own or of preceding
        times; principally as concerning the Church, and secondarily as
        concerning the world. To this use of them no objection in principle
        can be raised; and in so doing, we treat them exactly as we do
        ordinary writers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. We use them, as
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">evidence</span></em> of the state of the Church,
        in their own and preceding ages, as regards either <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">discipline</span></em> or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">morals</span></em>.
        In regard to the former, as it is a thing not in its nature liable to
        hasty alteration,—discipline established in one age continuing on,
        for the most part, into the next,—their testimony will avail for the
        immediately preceding generation, as well as for their own. In regard
        to the latter, it can scarcely be received for any thing anterior to
        their own age, unless where they record the observations of some
        older person. In both, moreover, it requires to be noted whether they
        are writing controversially or historically: because we all know that
        through the imperfection of our nature we are apt to overstate our
        own case, and to understate that of our opponents. And if that is the
        case now, when a more extended and more accurate education has
        disciplined the minds of writers to impartiality, how much more must
        it have been so in an earlier stage of controversial writing, when
        there had been no opportunity <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> for any such discipline. It is necessary,
        therefore, in the perusal of their controversial writings to be on
        our guard, and to notice, in any particular case, whether the mind of
        the writer is likely to have been influenced in his statements by any
        such bias. It must be remembered, moreover, that no individual author
        can be considered as evidence for the state of the universal Church,
        unless we have sufficient proof that he had means of knowing the
        condition of the whole Church, and unless we can gather that, being
        so qualified, he intends to speak thus largely.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, when not
        writing controversially, if we are aware that they laboured under any
        particular prejudice or bias, either towards any particular opinion
        or state of feeling, or against any particular class or individual,
        which is liable to affect their statements,—then likewise we must
        view them with caution.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other hand,
        when we have no evidence of any circumstance likely to pervert their
        perceptions, or to exaggerate their statements, it is obvious that
        they must be taken at their full value.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. We use the
        Fathers as evidence of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">doctrine</span></em> which was taught by the
        Church, in their own and preceding ages. And here some of the remarks
        just made will apply again. The Fathers, like all other writers,
        sometimes state their own individual opinions, or the views of
        doctrine which prevailed in the sect or party to which they were
        attached, or in the particular part of the Church in which they were
        placed, or in the age in which they lived: at other times, and more
        frequently, the doctrines of the whole Church, in <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id="Pgix"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> their own and all preceding ages. Now,
        where a writer states that what he is saying is held by the whole
        Church, unless we know any thing to the contrary, it is reasonable to
        believe that it was the case; because we know that the tradition of
        doctrine was, for the most part, jealously kept up by the perpetual
        intercourse and communication between the bishops of the several
        churches. And so again, where a writer affirms that any particular
        doctrine has been handed down from the beginning, unless we have
        opposing evidence, it is reasonable to take his word; because we know
        that it was the custom and practice of the whole Church to require
        every new bishop to confess the doctrine <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">already
        received</span></em>, and to teach its doctrines to new converts as
        already received. And, at all events, such a statement is conclusive
        evidence, that such doctrine had come down from a generation or two
        preceding that of the writer; unless (as was said before) we have
        proof to the contrary.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, as has been
        already stated, it is possible for an individual to be led away by
        controversy, or prejudice, or party bias; and therefore, when he is
        manifestly under any such influence, it is well to be on our guard.
        For that and other reasons, in any matter of serious doubt, it is
        impossible to rest upon the word of any single writer; but we use him
        as a link in the chain of evidence as to the doctrine taught from the
        beginning by the united universal Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. We use them to
        aid us in interpreting the text of Scripture. For many of them quote
        very largely from the Sacred Volume; and as some lived near
        apostolical times, and many wrote in the language in which the New
        Testament was written, whilst others were persons of great
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx" id=
        "Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> inquiry and learning, and lived
        nearer to the localities of the sacred events than we do,—they had
        advantages which we do not possess. When, therefore, several or many
        of them concur in giving one uniform meaning to particular passages
        of Scripture, the evidence becomes very strong that they had the
        right interpretation: and even where only one writer gives any
        assistance upon any particular text, we shall frequently see reason
        for accepting his acceptation of it in preference to more modern
        suggestions. At the same time it is necessary to bear in mind, that
        most of them knew nothing of the original language of the Old
        Testament; and that they are often only <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">applying</span></em>
        passages according to the prevalent habit (countenanced indeed by our
        Lord and his Apostles, but carried to various degrees of excess by
        most of the early writers) of seeking for mystical accommodations:
        and we must distinguish between application and interpretation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now these methods
        of employing the writings of the Fathers are <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">à
        priori</span></span> so obvious and so unobjectionable, that few
        writers of any credit object to the principle: but as the results of
        the application of the principle are highly inconvenient to those who
        have rejected the doctrine or discipline universally upheld in the
        primitive ages of the Church, two lines of argument have been taken
        to nullify this application. And as they have been lately revived in
        various ways, and particularly by the re-publication of the work from
        which most of them have been derived, viz. Daillé's Treatise
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">on the
        Right Use of the Fathers</span></span>, I have thought proper to
        notice them in that brief manner which the limits of a preface
        permit. Some, indeed, of the objections brought forward ought to be
        considered as simply <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg
        xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id="Pgxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        cautions to the inquirer, and as such I have already treated them;
        the chief remaining ones I now proceed to mention.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(1.) Some contend
        that, however reasonable in the abstract this sort of appeal to the
        Fathers may appear, it is beset with such difficulties, that it is
        useless in practice: that we have so few early writings, that those
        we have are so adulterated, that we have so many forgeries in the
        names of early writers, that the writings of the Fathers are so
        difficult to understand, that they so often give the opinions of
        others without any intimation that they are not their own, that they
        so constantly altered their views as they grew older, and that it so
        frequently happened that the men who are now of most note were in a
        minority of their contemporaries,—that it is practically useless to
        attempt to apply the Fathers to modern use.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now I do not deny
        that there is something in these difficulties; otherwise they would
        not have been brought forward at all. No doubt we have but few
        writings of sub-apostolical times: but then we must use such as we
        have, and illustrate their sense by such methods as are in our power;
        and we shall find that they give a clear and consistent testimony to
        several important matters, both of doctrine and of discipline. It
        might be true, when Daillé first wrote, that the very important
        epistles of S. Ignatius were much adulterated: but it is not so now;
        the genuine copies having become known to the world in his time:
        neither is it true to any considerable extent of subsequent writers;
        and when it is, it simply presents a difficulty, which must be
        surmounted as we best can, or must cast a doubt over any particular
        writing. Sermons <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg
        xii]</span><a name="Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        popular treatises of writers of note were often altered in
        transcribing; just as we, in these days, re-publish popular books
        with omissions and alterations suited to the change of times, or to
        the shade of difference between our own views and those of the
        writer: and for that reason works of that description, however useful
        for devotional reading and instruction, must be brought forward in
        controversy with more caution than others, and sometimes set aside
        altogether. In short there is need of judgment and discrimination in
        the use of the Fathers; and that is the whole amount of this
        difficulty. With regard to the difficulty of understanding them, that
        is of course a matter of degree, dependent upon the acquaintance of
        the student with the original languages, as used in the age and
        country of the writers, upon his acquaintance with Church history and
        the state of controversy, upon the degree of prejudice or false
        doctrine with which his own mind is imbued: but I do not think that
        they present nearly so much difficulty as the Platonical writers,
        which many persons study with great interest. As to the Fathers
        giving the opinions of others without intimating that they are so,
        that is no more than St. Paul himself does; and it very seldom
        occurs. So no doubt, like all other persons, they modify their views
        and occasionally change them, as they grow older: but that is, for
        the most part, only in subordinate matters, and it is very rarely
        that the circumstance presents any practical difficulty. Finally,
        that men whose name has become great amongst posterity were in a
        minority in their own age, is no doubt true in some instances: but
        when it is so, it can be ascertained, and must be allowed for; and
        when it cannot be ascertained it must not be surmised. And even where
        they were so, as in the case of Athanasius, they may be <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pagexiii">[pg xiii]</span><a name="Pgxiii" id=
        "Pgxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> connected with a majority in
        preceding and subsequent ages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So that these
        objections are partly such difficulties as occur in every study, (but
        stated with much exaggeration,) and partly flimsy unpractical cavils,
        not worth dwelling upon.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(2.) But supposing
        that the writings of the Fathers are intelligible upon many points,
        another class of objections arises. It is asserted that they were
        themselves often mistaken, that they even contradict one another, and
        in short that no class or party is really willing to abide by their
        decision.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here again, if
        they were mistaken, let it be shown by undoubted testimony (of Holy
        Writ or otherwise) that they were mistaken: but let no one take for
        granted that because they differ from the received notions of our own
        age, they were therefore in error. It should never be forgotten that
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every age
        has its errors</span></em>: and it may be, possibly, that wherein we
        differ from them the error is our own. No doubt each eminent writer
        then, as each eminent writer now, was in some respects mistaken. It
        is the simple condition of humanity to be liable to error. But as
        that does not cause us to refuse the testimony of our contemporaries,
        or their aid in the pursuit of truth, so it need not cause us to turn
        a deaf ear to the earlier writers. The circumstance that in some
        respects each was in error only renders their combined testimony to
        truth more weighty. It has indeed been asserted that they were all in
        error upon certain points: <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexiv">[pg
        xiv]</span><a name="Pgxiv" id="Pgxiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> but
        that assertion the Author has elsewhere<a id="noteref_1" name=
        "noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> shown to
        be totally destitute of truth. Again, with regard to their
        contradictions of each other, where they do occur they should of
        course be noted; but the cases will be found to be of little
        practical importance; and their differences upon some points only
        place in a clearer light their agreement where they do agree. Lastly,
        as to the alleged fact that no class or party heartily accepts even
        the combined evidence of the Fathers, it is certainly true of two
        opposite parties; viz. the Roman Church and those Protestants who
        have rejected the Apostolical succession,—both setting up modern
        opinions to oppose or to explain away primitive doctrine: but it is
        not true of the Church of England, which (as has been frequently
        shown) both formally recognizes the consent of Catholic Doctors, and
        does in point of fact, in her public acts and documents, agree
        substantially in doctrine and discipline with that consent, so far as
        it has yet been ascertained; whatever instances have been brought
        forward to the contrary being mistakes in matter of fact.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">5. But besides
        this use of the Fathers as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">evidence</span></em>, many persons attribute to
        them a certain degree of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">authority</span></em>; and greater objection is
        felt to appealing to them as authority, than to using them as
        testimony. There are, however, very different ways of treating them
        as authority.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now to quote
        sentences of the Fathers, as we do texts of Holy Writ, as being
        infallibly conclusive, (which has been <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexv">[pg xv]</span><a name="Pgxv" id="Pgxv" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> done by writers of the Roman Church, especially
        before Daillé's time,) can only be done in ignorance or in bad faith;
        because every person acquainted with them knows that, like all
        uninspired writers, they differ from each other and from themselves.
        But if we simply quote them as persons whose opinion or testimony
        ought to have with us very great weight, either for what they were in
        themselves, or for the age in which they lived, this is a quite
        different matter; it is constantly done in the Homilies of the
        Church; and there surely can be no valid objection to it. We do not
        hesitate to appeal to the judgment of the great lights of our own
        Church, and to regard their dicta as not to be lightly questioned,
        partly for their own learning, judgment, and piety, (as Hooker,
        Sanderson, Wilson, Waterland,) partly for the era in which they
        flourished, (as Cranmer, Ridley, Jewel:) we give them authority over
        our own minds, and in deciding controversies between ourselves; and
        what valid objection can be raised to our giving corresponding weight
        to the worthies of more ancient times? And as the earliest writers
        conversed either with Apostles, or with those who had heard the
        Apostles, it is natural to attribute greater weight to their words
        than to those of subsequent writers. And what if they do show whilst
        writing, that they had no anticipation of being guides to posterity?
        what if they caution us against trusting them implicitly, and
        recommend us to search the Scriptures for ourselves? what if they
        were sometimes in error? Do not all these circumstances apply to
        those more modern authors whom we do not hesitate to recognize as, in
        themselves, authorities? and why then should we be reluctant to yield
        to the more ancient that authority, as individuals, which all
        subsequent time has <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexvi">[pg
        xvi]</span><a name="Pgxvi" id="Pgxvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        accorded to them? Authority may be great without being infallible.
        Authority may have weighty influence upon the judgment without
        directly binding the conscience.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These remarks and
        arguments are capable of being stated much more fully, and of being
        illustrated by instances throughout; but to do so would require a
        separate treatise; and it has been thought better to produce them
        thus nakedly than to omit them altogether.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is proper to
        state that the editions of Irenæus and of other Fathers referred to
        are chiefly the Benedictine: Clement of Alexandria is quoted in the
        edition of Klotz, and Eusebius in that of Zimmermann.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If Polycarp is an
        object of great interest, as the disciple of St. John, and the hearer
        both of him and of other contemporaries of our Lord; if Justin is so,
        as having been the first man of eminent learning who came over from
        the walks of heathen philosophy to submit his mind to the doctrine of
        Christ; Irenæus, again, has claims upon our attention scarcely less,
        as having been brought up in the Christian faith under the eye of
        Polycarp; having, therefore, no previous tinge of Judaism or heathen
        philosophy, but imbued with Christian principles almost, if not
        quite, from his cradle, and at the same time displaying equal vigour
        of mind, if not equal knowledge of heathen learning, with either
        Justin or Clement of Alexandria<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2"
        href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>. To these
        circumstances we are no doubt to attribute it, that there appear in
        his writings a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg
        002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        greater justness of reasoning, and a more unexceptionable use of
        scripture, than is to be found in the writers of the Alexandrian
        school.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to the
        time of his birth we know nothing certain. We find him <em class=

        listening to the Christian instruction of Polycarp, not long, as it
        would appear, before the death of that martyr. For, after
        saying<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        account for what might appear improbable, viz., his being the
        contemporary of that martyr at all,—he says, that Polycarp lived to a
        very advanced age; ἐπιπολὺ γὰρ παρέμεινε, καὶ πάνυ γεραλέος ...
        ἐξῆλθε τοῦ βίου. This makes it evident that it must have taken place
        towards the very close of Polycarp's life; and yet not so near to it
        but that he had had time to mark<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5"
        href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his manner

        remembered <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">his account of his familiar intercourse with the
        apostle John, and the survivors of those who had seen the Lord, and
        his rehearsals of their sayings, and of their accounts of the
        discourses and miracles of the Lord</span></em>. All this would
        require, one should suppose, at least five or six years. Then, again,
        we are to bear in mind that he would not have been capable of marking
        things of such a nature, (so as to remember them, as he tells us he
        did, perfectly,) when a young child, nor until his mind had in some
        degree begun to expand. So that we can scarcely suppose him younger
        than sixteen at the time of Polycarp's martyrdom, and the expression
        παῖς would admit of his being some years older.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dodwell<a id=
        "noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>, indeed,
        has endeavoured to arrive at greater accuracy, and thinks that, by
        another casual expression of Irenæus, in his <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">letter to
        Florinus</span></span>, he is enabled to fix the date absolutely.
        Irenæus remarks <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg
        004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        that he had seen Florinus, when himself still a lad, in the company
        of Polycarp, in Lower Asia; when at the same time Florinus was
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">getting on
        very prosperously at the court of the emperor</span></em>: λαμπρῶς
        πράττοντα ἐν τῇ βασιλικῇ αὐλῇ. Taking it for granted that Irenæus
        intends to say that he was an actual witness of the prosperity of his
        friend, and consequently that the imperial court must have been at
        that very time sojourning in Lower Asia, and having ascertained that
        Adrian is the only emperor who appears to have remained any time
        there, he fixes upon the year 122 as the probable year in which
        Adrian might have been there, and thus imagines that he has
        established at least one date with certainty. Now the stress of the
        observation of Irenæus does not lie upon the success of Florinus at
        court, but upon his having associated with Polycarp, and having
        endeavoured to gain his good opinion; that, so far as appears, is the
        only thing which Irenæus <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">witnessed</span></em>. The imperial court may
        therefore have been at some other place, and Florinus may have been
        only on a visit at Smyrna, at the time when Irenæus saw him
        there.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is another
        objection to this hypothesis of Dodwell, and that is, that it is
        inconsistent with the date of the martyrdom of Polycarp, which took
        place <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 166-7. We have seen
        above that Irenæus could not have known him for many years before his
        death, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name=
        "Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> whereas Dodwell's
        notion would require him to have been acquainted with him forty years
        before, when it is impossible Polycarp could have been <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very old</span></em>,
        to say nothing of Irenæus' implication as to its having been towards
        the close of his life. If we suppose, then, that he was acquainted
        with him for six or eight years, and that he was about eighteen at
        the time of his martyrdom, it will make the birth of Irenæus to have
        taken place about the year 150. This, at all events, is the latest
        date we can assign to it. Dupin<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7"
        href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> and

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> twenty
        years earlier; and Dodwell is desirous of carrying it up ten or
        twenty years earlier still. Perhaps Massuet's date may be nearest the
        truth. But exactness in these particulars is of the less moment, as
        we have, established by his own mouth, the main circumstance on
        account of which it is of importance to ascertain it: for the chief,
        if not the only, reason for desiring to fix the date of his birth is,
        that we may judge what kind of witness he is likely to have been of
        apostolical tradition. Now we have seen him expressly affirming that
        he had heard Polycarp recount the narratives and doctrines of St.
        John and other contemporaries of Christ; and he likewise informs us
        he paid diligent attention to him, and that he remembered him so
        minutely that he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg
        006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        could<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href=

        out the place where he sat, and trace the walks he was accustomed to
        take; and moreover, that he not only heard his words, but treasured
        them up in his memory, and was continually refreshing his remembrance
        of them by meditation upon them. The testimony of such a witness must
        be more than ordinarily valuable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon the death of
        Polycarp, it is probable that he put himself under the guidance of
        Papias, as he is called by Jerome<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11"
        href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">disciple</span></em>. Certain it is, that he
        several times quotes that pious but too credulous writer, and that
        with evident approbation. There is likewise a person, whom he does
        not name, but whom he often mentions<a id="noteref_12" name=
        "noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a>, from
        whom he appears to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg
        007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        have learnt much, and who was a contemporary of the apostolical
        generation. Some have conjectured him to have been the same as
        Papias<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href=
        "#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a>. Dodwell
        thinks him to have been Pothinus<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14"
        href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>, the
        predecessor of Irenæus in the see of Lyons; yet, if he had been
        either one or the other of them, there appears no reason why he
        should not have named him; for he does mention Papias by name more
        than once, and Pothinus was likewise a person of sufficient eminence
        to have been quoted by name. The probability appears to be, that he
        was a person of no great note, but who had the advantage of being a
        hearer of those who had seen the Lord<a id="noteref_15" name=
        "noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How long Irenæus
        continued to reside in Asia Minor we know not; but we find him next

        venerable bishop. What led him there we are not informed. The place
        lay a good way up the Rhone, near the mouth of which was Marseilles,
        a Greek colony from Phocæa in Asia Minor<a id="noteref_18" name=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> him thither, or even to Lyons itself. For
        although this latter was a Roman colony, and its name, Lugdunum,
        sufficiently evinces that it was not of Greek foundation, yet the
        number of Greek names<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href=
        "#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> amongst
        the Christians there shows that there must have been many of that
        race residing there. Indeed, the circumstance that the Montanist
        heresy, which arose in Phrygia, spread in no long time to Lyons, and
        that the Lyonnese wrote to the churches in Asia and Phrygia, both to
        give an account of the persecution, and to discountenance the
        opinions of Montanus, clearly prove that there was some reason for
        frequent intercourse and sympathy between Lyons and Asia Minor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no
        reason, therefore, to conjecture any extraordinary mission or other
        conjuncture to bring him into that part of the world. He may have
        been ordained priest after he arrived there; but we cannot argue that
        with any certainty from his being called by Jerome<a id="noteref_20"
        name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class=

        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a priest of
        Pothinus</span></em>; for even when church discipline attained its
        greatest strictness, and every bishop regarded an ecclesiastic
        ordained by himself as his subject, there was nothing to prevent a
        bishop from transferring one of his clergy to the jurisdiction
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010"
        id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of another bishop, whose
        subject he thenceforward became. So that the epithet made use of by
        Jerome only proves—what we know from Eusebius<a id="noteref_21" name=
        "noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a>—that
        Irenæus was a priest of the diocese of Lyons when Pothinus was
        bishop.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is the more
        necessary to remark this, as there appears to be a disposition
        gaining ground to take the slightest evidence as absolute proof.
        Undoubtedly a sceptical disposition is a great mischief; but a
        credulous temper, although less injurious to the possessor, is no
        slight evil, from its natural tendency to produce scepticism by an
        unavoidable reaction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But wheresoever
        Irenæus first entered into the priesthood, he had abode so long at

        so relied upon as to be chosen by the martyrs of Lyons, then in
        prison, as a fit person to send to Eleutherus, bishop of Rome, with
        their testimony against the Montanists. It is, indeed, barely said by
        Eusebius<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href=
        "#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        their epistles were written for the purpose of promoting the peace of
        the churches (τῆς τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν εἰρήνης ἕνεκα πρεσβεύοντες); but
        connecting them, as he does in his narrative, with the mention of the
        Montanist heresy, and of the dissensions occasioned by it (διαφωνίας
        ὑπαρχούσης περὶ τῶν δεδηλωμένων), it is unavoidable to conclude that
        they had reference to it. Some light may be thrown upon the subject
        by the assertion of Tertullian<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25"

        because Praxeas did not appear as a heretic at an earlier period.
        This, however, as Massuet justly argues<a id="noteref_28" name=
        "noteref_28" href="#note_28"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">28</span></span></a>, is not
        conclusive; for the throwing together two things in a narrative by no
        means proves that they closely followed each other; and this visit of
        Praxeas to Rome may, with greater probability, be assumed to have
        been when he was a catholic. A sufficient space of time had evidently
        elapsed between the visit of Praxeas to Rome, under the bishop who
        had granted communicatory letters to the Montanists, and the time
        when Tertullian was writing<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href=
        "#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>, to
        allow of his becoming tinged with the Patripassian heresy, of his
        disseminating it secretly, of his avowing it openly, of his being
        convinced of his error, and being reconciled to the church; finally,
        of his relapsing, and ultimately quitting the church. All this would
        take up many <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg
        013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        years, and allow ample time for the supposition that Eleutherus was
        the bishop alluded to; not to say that a bishop of Rome was little
        likely to have listened to him when an avowed heretic. And then the
        letter of the martyrs has a well-defined object, viz., to dissuade
        him from contributing to rend the church in pieces by countenancing a
        set of men who had been excommunicated by the churches by whom they
        were surrounded, and by those in Gaul with which they were in some
        degree connected; and thoroughly explains the expression of Eusebius,
        τῆς τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν εἰρήνης ἕνεκα πρεσβεύοντες.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is another
        circumstance, which, so far as I know, has not been adverted to:
        viz., that the Montanists appear not to have differed from the other
        Christians of Asia Minor in the observance of Easter; and as we know
        that Victor excommunicated those Churches for differing from him, he
        is not likely to have patronized a sect who also differed from him in
        a matter he regarded as so important.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As we know that
        the Church of Lyons sent these letters to Eleutherus, with one of
        their own, preserved in part by Eusebius<a id="noteref_30" name=
        "noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a>, giving
        an account of the martyrdoms, it has been supposed by some that
        Irenæus actually <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">wrote</span></em> this letter; and the idea is
        confirmed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg
        014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by
        the circumstance, that Œcumenius, in his <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Commentary on the First
        Epistle of St. Peter</span></span>, (cap. 3. p. 498.) has preserved a
        fragment of a writing of Irenæus, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">concerning Sanctus and
        Blandina</span></span>. Now, these two persons are mentioned
        particularly in the letter of the Church of Lyons<a id="noteref_31"
        name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>; of
        which, therefore, this fragment (numbered xiii. in the Benedictine
        edition) is probably another remnant. There is no ground for doubting
        that Irenæus did really visit Rome; the more especially, as two of
        his subsequent compositions were occasioned by errors of priests of
        that Church—viz. Florinus and Blastus<a id="noteref_32" name=
        "noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pothinus died in
        this persecution, as really a martyr as others who have been regarded
        as more truly such. Being upwards of ninety years old, suffering
        under infirmity both of age and sickness, dragged to the tribunal,
        and back again to prison, without any regard to his weakness and age,
        beaten, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name=
        "Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> kicked, and assailed
        with every missile that came to hand, it is more wonderful that he
        did not breathe his last under their hands, than that he lingered out
        two days in the prison<a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href=
        "#note_33"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        succeeded him<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href=
        "#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>; and if
        we may judge of him by the ability, learning, zeal, and sound
        judgment displayed in his writings, and by the Christian temper he
        evinced on the occasion of the paschal controversy, we may safely
        conclude that he was a more than worthy successor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before I proceed
        further, I will observe a little upon the visit of Irenæus to Rome,
        which appears to have been the third application made to Rome from
        any distant Church; the first being from Corinth, under St. Clement,
        the second by Polycarp, to Anicetus. The first was not unnatural,
        when we consider that Clement had been the companion of St. Paul, and
        that the Church of Corinth was under pecuniary obligations to that of
        Rome. The second was a consultation, as between equals. The third was
        a deputation from the Churches of an adjacent country, (civilly
        subject to Rome, and therefore in the habit of visiting the city,) to
        expostulate with the then bishop upon an injudicious step he had
        taken. They were evidently led to it by their sympathy with the
        Asiatic Churches, from whence they <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> drew their own origin, whose divisions and
        errors they deplored: and they were afraid of the mischief likely to
        accrue to the Christian world from the sanction given to the
        Montanist errors by the head of a Church so important as that of
        Rome, to which, from its being the common resort of Christians from
        all quarters, they had been in the habit of looking as the depository
        of their common traditions, and whose example therefore must be
        tenfold more hurtful than that of any other Church, if given on the
        side of error. It was, moreover, in all probability, an expostulation
        with him for having committed the actual error of countenancing what
        the whole catholic Church, from first to last, has declared to be
        delusion and heresy; and the object of it was, to entreat him to
        recant his error. How contrary is this whole matter to the notion of
        these Churches being subject to that of Rome, or to their looking up
        to the bishop of it as an authorized director in cases of doubt and
        difficulty! And even if we do not admit that Eleutherus was the
        actual bishop who gave his letters of peace to the Montanists, yet it
        has always been acknowledged that the letters of the martyrs, thus
        sent by the public authority of the Gaulish Churches, were intended
        to caution him against entertaining them, and that either he or
        Victor did countenance them. And how inconsistent is such a state of
        things with the idea of a Church privileged to be free from error or
        delusion, watching <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg
        017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        over others, instead of being watched over by them!</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One other point
        about this visit remains to be noticed. It has been supposed<a id=
        "noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> that
        Irenæus went to Rome to be consecrated to the Church of Lyons, or
        that he was consecrated there. That he <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">went</span></em>
        there for any such purpose is contrary to all the evidence we have,
        which specifies another cause for his journey, and does not hint at
        this. Massuet, indeed, argues, from Jerome's relating his visit to
        Rome immediately before his ordination, as successor to
        Pothinus<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href=
        "#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>, that
        the two must have an explicit connexion with each other; but the very
        connecting term <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">postea</span></span>, and the
        reason given with it, that Pothinus had suffered martyrdom, would
        rather appear to separate the journey with its circumstances, from
        the ordination with its reason. He likewise relies upon the request
        of the martyrs to Eleutherus, ἔχειν σε αὐτὸν ἐν παραθέσει<a id=
        "noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a>; which
        he chooses to translate, <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style="font-style: italic">ut ipsum cæteris
        anteponas</span></span>. So very much to be drawn from one word,
        reminds one of Dodwell's theories. The expression might, indeed,
        possibly have a force, which it is rather surprising that Massuet has
        overlooked. It might mean <span class="tei tei-q">“place <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> him by thy side,”</span> which, if it had
        occurred to the French divine, he would probably have translated,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Elatum eum fac in eundem quem ipse tenes
        ordinem:”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Make him a bishop like
        thyself.”</span> But when we take it in connexion with the concluding
        clause, ἐν πρώτοις ἂν παρεθέμεθα, the phrase would appear to signify
        nothing more than, <span class="tei tei-q">“Treat him with all
        respect.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That he may have
        been consecrated when there, if Pothinus died in the interim, is not
        impossible; for it has not been unusual, in all ages of the Church,
        for a bishop elect to be consecrated in the place where he happened
        to be at the time of his election. But there is no <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">evidence</span></em>
        for this; nothing, in short, but the presumption, that there was no
        other bishop in Gaul but the bishop of Lyons. And if there were, as
        is not improbable, bishops of Autun, of Arles, and of Vienne, at this
        time, then there was no motive whatever for having recourse to the
        bishop of Rome, at a period when, as is well known, the neighbouring
        bishops always filled up a vacancy, with the consent of the clergy
        and people, without having recourse to any higher or ulterior
        authority. But supposing that he was consecrated at Rome, it makes
        nothing whatever for the supremacy of that see. I am willing to grant
        to it a much higher rank and authority than such a circumstance would
        vindicate for it. Ignatius, when going to martyrdom, besought
        Polycarp <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page019">[pg
        019]</span><a name="Pg019" id="Pg019" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to
        appoint a bishop in his place; and yet no one has thought fit, on
        that ground, to claim for Polycarp the title even of primate of the
        East; whilst I readily admit that the bishop of Rome was long looked
        up to, not only as primate of the West, but as the first bishop
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
        rank</span></em>, and governing the first Church <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
        authority</span></em>, in the whole Christian world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But whatever may
        be doubtful, one thing is certain, that Irenæus <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did</span></em>
        succeed Pothinus as bishop of Lyons. Of his conduct in his own
        particular Church we have no means of judging, for no record has
        survived to tell us of anything he did there. It appears certain,
        from the expression of Eusebius<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38"
        href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a>,
        ἐπεσκόπει τῶν κατὰ Γαλλίαν παροικιῶν, that he was primate, or, at
        least, had influence over several dioceses in Gaul; as παροικία in
        the early writers commonly signifies <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
        diocese</span></em><a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href=
        "#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">39</span></span></a>. This
        idea is farther confirmed by the use of a parallel expression<a id=
        "noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href="#note_40"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">40</span></span></a>, to
        describe the jurisdiction of the bishop of Alexandria. It is well
        known that, in the time of Athanasius, the number of dioceses under
        him was near a hundred<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href=
        "#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a>; of
        these, between seventy and eighty were in Egypt, and sixteen within
        seventy miles of Alexandria, and in the same civil province of
        Ægyptus Prima. Over all these, the bishop of Alexandria exercised a
        control more complete <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg
        020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        than that of any other patriarch of those times. I mention these
        circumstances to show that, at the time to which Eusebius refers, his
        archiepiscopal province must have been considerable. And as the
        ecclesiastical station of Irenæus is described in the same terms, it
        almost amounts to demonstration, that he held a similar pre-eminence.
        The only difference is, that Irenæus is said to have ruled the
        παροικιῶν κατὰ Γαλλίαν, and the bishop of Alexandria those κατ᾽
        Ἀλεξάνδρειαν. But this expression only shows that the Churches in
        Egypt emanated from Alexandria, and were permanently dependent upon
        it; whilst those in Gaul emanated from no point within the country,
        nor were permanently dependent upon any one church. If any one should
        suppose that the term παροικία is used with regard to Alexandria in
        its modern sense of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">parish</span></em>, and that Eusebius is
        speaking of the extent of the single diocese of Alexandria, I will
        only say, that that whole diocese contained only fourteen pastors,
        that the city contained sixteen churches<a id="noteref_42" name=
        "noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a>; and
        that Socrates, who wrote more than one hundred years after Eusebius,
        when describing the distinction of the pastoral charges in the
        diocese of Alexandria, merely says<a id="noteref_43" name=
        "noteref_43" href="#note_43"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a>, that
        they were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">like</span></em> παροικίαι: so that this word
        had retained its meaning of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">diocese</span></em> even to that
        period.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Massuet, indeed,
        argues at great length<a id="noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href=
        "#note_44"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> against
        the idea that there was any other bishop in Gaul than the bishop of
        Lyons; but all his arguments resolve themselves into the one, that
        there is no mention made in any early writer of any other. On this
        ground one might, with equal reason, conclude that there were no
        bishops in Britain before the council of Arles, when they are first
        mentioned. But until it can be shown that there is an instance in any
        writer anterior to Eusebius, or of his time, of the use of the term
        παροικία to signify a parochial church or parish, the simple use of
        this word by him is sufficient evidence against all negative
        arguments whatever. What the author of the Acts of the Martyrdom of
        St. Saturninus says<a id="noteref_45" name="noteref_45" href=
        "#note_45"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">45</span></span></a> of the
        fewness of churches in Gaul in his time is really no contradiction to
        this opinion; for if there were at that time as many as twenty or
        thirty, it would be extremely few, considering the extent of the
        country.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have said that
        we have no record of the operations of Irenæus as bishop of Lyons. I
        mean, that we know of nothing which he did in that particular church.
        He bore, in a general way, the character of <span class=

        of comparatively recent date, that he sent a priest and deacon as
        missionaries to Besançon, and a priest and two deacons to Valence, in
        Dauphiné. The circumstance is very probable in itself, and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023"
        id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is in agreement with the
        traditions of those Churches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We now come to a
        more remarkable period of his life. We have seen that the Christians
        of that age looked with peculiar anxiety to Rome, as the Church
        where, from the constant meeting together of Christians from the
        provinces, the traditions of the catholic Church were most accurately
        preserved. Any departure of that Church from purity of doctrine would
        be of more serious consequence than the deflexion of one of less
        influence. Irenæus had been taught to exercise this feeling by his
        mission from the martyrs; and had no doubt learnt to feel it more
        deeply on the spot, when he trode the ground consecrated by the
        martyrdom of the two great apostles with whose joint superintendence
        and instruction that Church was so long favoured, and when he
        observed how every heretic likewise resorted to Rome, as a more
        important theatre than any other. Nor can we suppose that he had left
        that Church without forming some bond of union with individual
        members of it. His heart, therefore, returned no doubt to it, and
        caused him to indite those several epistles Eusebius mentions<a id=
        "noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a>,
        occasioned by the dissensions he heard of as prevailing there. The
        first mentioned by the historian is that addressed to Blastus on the
        subject of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">schism</span></em>. What it was which led
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024"
        id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> him into schism is variously
        related by ancient writers. Eusebius simply says<a id="noteref_50"
        name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> that he
        indulged in speculations of his own at variance with truth.
        Theodoret<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href=
        "#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> stated
        that he was entangled in the errors of Marcion and Valentinus; but if
        he had been so at that time, it appears most probable that Irenæus
        would have noticed the errors themselves even more prominently than
        the schism which accompanied them. A more probable account is that
        given by the ancient author whose addition to one of Tertullian's
        works is commonly printed with it<a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52"
        href="#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a>, that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“he wished covertly to introduce
        Judaism;”</span> and in particular, that <span class="tei tei-q">“he
        insisted on the observance of the paschal season on the fourteenth
        day of the moon, according to the law of Moses;”</span> with which
        agrees what Pacian says<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href=
        "#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a>,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that he was a Greek, and that he adhered to
        the Montanists;”</span> for the Montanists, having arisen in Asia
        Minor, celebrated that season at the same time as the other
        Christians of that country, i. e. with the Jews. So that his schism
        probably consisted in this, that having come from Asia, he wished to
        raise a party favourable to the Asiatic practice, or, at least,
        declined to conform to that of Rome. And we can imagine how earnestly
        Irenæus would press him to conform to the usages of the Church in
        which he sojourned; a thing he could do with so much greater
        authority, inasmuch <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg
        025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as,
        being himself of Asiatic birth, and brought up in the very church of
        Polycarp, he had conformed to the Western usage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether it was
        before or after this time that Blastus left the communion of the
        Church we know not. Eusebius, however, relates<a id="noteref_54"
        name="noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a>, (at
        least so Massuet<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href=
        "#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a>, with
        great probability, apprehends his meaning,) that he was deposed from
        the priesthood, and that he detached many from the Church to follow
        speculations of his own, at variance with the truth. Theodoret's
        statement may therefore be substantially correct, although at a
        period subsequent to that at which Irenæus wrote the letter Περὶ
        Σχίσματος.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next letter
        Eusebius mentions is that to Florinus. This person was likewise a
        priest of the Church at Rome, and had been known to Irenæus in early
        life<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a>, when
        they were both pupils of Polycarp, and Florinus was high in the court
        of the reigning emperor. But he had forsaken civil life, and entered
        holy orders, from which he was now ejected, as being the head of a
        party holding novel and peculiar <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> opinions<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57"
        href="#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a>. His
        peculiarity is distinctly specified, viz. that he taught that God was
        the author of evil. To avoid this conclusion, Marcion had taught two
        first principles—the one of good, the other of evil. It was probably
        in combating this error that Florinus had insisted on the unity of
        God, and of his providential government, which he had expressed by
        the term μοναρχία, and, from opposing one heresy with zeal too ardent
        for his judgment, had fallen into the opposite one. Irenæus, upon
        hearing of the fall of his former acquaintance, felt an earnest
        desire to restore him, and accordingly wrote to him, endeavouring, as
        it would appear, to explain the true notion of the μοναρχία of God,
        and especially to combat his peculiar error. A fragment of this
        letter is preserved by Eusebius<a id="noteref_58" name="noteref_58"
        href="#note_58"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a>, and
        printed<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href=
        "#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a> at the
        end of the best editions of the works of Irenæus. In it Irenæus
        represents to him how much at variance his opinions were with those
        of the Church; how impious in their tendency; how far beyond what any
        excommunicated heretic had ever taught; how much opposed to
        apostolical tradition: and he appeals to him from his own remembrance
        of the teaching of Polycarp (whom they had mutually reverenced), and
        from his published epistles, how shocked that blessed martyr would
        have been if he had heard such blasphemies.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg 027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Irenæus, as it
        would appear, succeeded only so far with the unstable Florinus as to
        drive him from his position, that God was the author of evil. From
        this he went into the Valentinian speculations, by which they
        endeavour to escape the great difficulty of the origin of evil<a id=
        "noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a>. From
        them he learnt to believe in an <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ogdoad</span></span> of emanations from the
        Supreme Being, from one of the later of whom, by a species of
        accident, evil sprung. Irenæus could not give up his ancient friend,
        but composed for his use a treatise<a id="noteref_61" name=
        "noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> upon
        this portion of the Gnostic theory. Of this, however, we have not a
        fragment left which can throw any light upon its structure. There is
        only the concluding sentence preserved<a id="noteref_62" name=
        "noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>, in
        which he adjures the transcriber of it to compare it most carefully
        with the original, and to append the adjuration itself to his
        transcript. We might wonder, perhaps, at the solemnity of the
        adjuration, did we not consider how important it was that Irenæus
        himself should not be represented, by any error of the copyist, as
        holding opinions at variance with the truth he was so anxious to
        maintain. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg
        028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> But
        although we have no distinct remains of this particular treatise, it
        is highly probable that it formed the germ of that great work which
        has, in some sort, remained entire, and upon which the reputation of
        Irenæus, as a controversial writer, altogether rests. To that I will
        now direct my attention.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Gnostic
        theories had risen in the East, and from thence had early spread to
        Rome; whither came, in succession, most of their eminent teachers. It
        is not my purpose to give a full account of them. This has been done
        by the late Dr. E. Burton, in his Bampton Lectures, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">On the heresies of the apostolical
        age</span></span>,”</span> and the notes appended to them. I shall,
        however, give in detail Irenæus's account of them in a subsequent
        part of this work. The general principle of them all was to escape
        making God the author of evil, by making it to spring, by a species
        of chance, from some emanation indefinitely removed from the great
        First Cause. For this purpose, they imagined certain spiritual
        beings, more or less numerous, the first pair produced by the Supreme
        Being, in conjunction with an emanation from himself; the rest
        emanating, for the most part, successively from each preceding pair,
        and becoming more and more liable to infirmity as they were further
        distant from the One Original. From one of the most distant they
        imagined the author of evil to have sprung, whom they also made the
        creator of the world, and the god <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the Jews. They professed to believe in
        Jesus, but regarded him either as not truly man or as not truly
        united with the Godhead; and Christ, as well as the Only-begotten,
        the Saviour, and the Life, they looked on as distinct from him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great charm of
        these theories was, that they professed to unravel a great secret,
        which no previous philosophy had reached, and which Christianity
        itself had left untouched. We may wonder, indeed, that any Christian
        should have found anything to tempt him in hypotheses so subtile and
        intricate, and so palpably at variance with the known truths of the
        Gospel. But we must bear in mind that when they first arose, no part
        of the New-Testament scripture was written; that consequently the
        poison had time to mix itself with the current of opinion everywhere,
        before an antidote of general application was provided; that the
        minds of all inquiring men in those times were peculiarly given to
        subtilties, and to the notion of inventing schemes selected from all
        prevailing opinions; and that, to recommend themselves to Christians,
        they professed to be the depositories of that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“hidden wisdom”</span> which St. Paul was known to have
        affirmed that he had imparted to those who were capable of receiving
        it. It is, therefore, not much to be wondered at, that they prevailed
        amongst the speculative for their very subtilty, and with the vain
        and weak-minded by their affectation of superior
        wisdom.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg
        030]</span><a name="Pg030" id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was another
        feature of the scheme, which served a further purpose. They pretended
        that the minds which inhabit human bodies are of two kinds,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">spiritual</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">carnal</span></em>;
        that the carnal alone are the work of the Creator of this world,
        whilst the spiritual are emanations from the highest and purest order
        of spiritual beings: that the carnal are readily contaminated by the
        flesh and the world, and thence require restraint and law; whilst the
        spiritual are only placed in bodies for a time, that they may
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">know</span></em> everything, but incapable of
        contamination, and destined, after a period of exercise, to be taken
        up into the Supernal Fulness. By this theory the abstracted and
        mystical were flattered with the idea of spiritual superiority to
        their fellow-men; whilst the worldly and sensual might keep up the
        highest pretensions, and yet wallow in the most revolting profligacy.
        It was under this latter phase that Gnosticism first showed itself
        amongst the half-civilized, semi-Roman inhabitants of southern Gaul.
        In its more abstract and refined form it would have had no attraction
        for them; for the European mind is too plain and common-sense to
        follow subtilties. But its practical licentiousness found a fit nidus
        in the accompanying sensual disposition which marked the Romans of
        that age, and all who were tinged with their blood. It worked its way
        for some time in silence, till the attention of the bishop of Lyons
        was drawn to it by the seduction of Christian matrons, and by the
        influx of extraordinary impurity throughout <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> that region<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63"
        href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a>. He was
        thus led to trace the mischief to its cause; and finding this to be
        his old enemy, under its then prevailing form of Valentinianism,
        which thus appeared to be rearing its head everywhere, and had now
        come to assail him on his own ground, he set himself to understand
        its system thoroughly, that, by refuting it both in its principle and
        in its details, he might completely disabuse the Christian world, do
        away with the divisions, and impurities, and calumnies, arising from
        it, and thus afford the freer scope for the power of truth upon the
        hearts and practice of men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was the more
        determined upon doing this by <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the solicitations of a friend, who appears to
        have lived more in the heart of the mischief than himself<a id=
        "noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a>. Who he
        was we are not told. That he had some pastoral charge is most
        probable, from the concluding portion of the preface to the first
        book, in which Irenæus speaks to his friend as having spiritual care
        of others, and as able, both by his station and by his abilities, to
        turn to the best account the hints he was able to furnish him. That
        the native, or at least customary, language of his friend was Greek,
        may be inferred from the work being in that language, and by the
        apology made for the imperfections of the style; and altogether, it
        seems most probable that he was a bishop of one of the Greek colonies
        of southern Gaul.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
        accomplishment of this work he no doubt <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> made use of the treatise of Justin Martyr
        against the Marcionites, now lost to us, because superseded by the
        completer work of Irenæus. But he derived the greatest help from the
        writings of the Gnostics themselves, from which he learnt their
        scheme without any possibility of doubt or gainsaying, and thus was
        enabled, by the mere <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">statement</span></em>, in open light, of its
        fantastic puerilities, to unclothe it of the mystery which was one of
        its chief recommendations, to demonstrate more clearly its
        self-contradictions, and to contrast it in its naked folly with the
        simplicity of acknowledged truth<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65"
        href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the
        ascertaining of the date of this composition we have but two certain
        guides. One is, the list of bishops of Rome given in the beginning of
        the third book<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href=
        "#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a>. The
        catalogue closes with the name of Eleutherus, and thus shows that
        that book, at least, was begun, and most probably published, under
        his pontificate, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg
        034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        which began about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 177. The other is, that
        in the same book the author mentions the translation of the Old
        Testament by Theodotion<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href=
        "#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a>. Now
        that translation was not made till about <span class=

        would not become acquainted with it immediately; so that we are
        driven towards the end of the pontificate of Eleutherus, who died
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        publication of the third book. The work appears to have grown upon
        the hands of the writer, and to have become more than twice as

        "#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a>. The
        first <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name=
        "Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> seven chapters contain
        a detailed account of the system of Valentinus, who was at that time
        the most fashionable teacher of those doctrines. The eighth gives the
        Valentinian explanation of numerous passages of Scripture, which they
        brought forward as corroborative of the truth of their system,
        although they did not pretend to rest it upon them; and the ninth
        refutes those explanations. The tenth points out the unity of
        Catholic doctrine, and the remaining chapters are occupied in
        exhibiting the discrepancies of the various Gnostic sects and
        teachers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The object of the
        second book is to overthrow the system, both in its principle and in
        its details, by demonstrating its contradictoriness and
        impossibility<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href=
        "#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a>. The
        first nineteen chapters are occupied in the destruction of the
        system; the next five are a fuller refutation of their arguments in
        support of it than he had given in chapter nine of the first book;
        and the twenty-sixth, twenty-seventh, and twenty-eighth <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> lay down certain rules for the proper
        study of the Scriptures. The rest of the book is taken up with a
        fuller consideration and refutation of particular opinions held by
        Gnostics.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Irenæus himself
        states it to be the object of the third book to confute the heretical
        system by Scripture, as containing in writing the undoubted doctrine
        of those apostles through whose preaching the economy of salvation
        was originally revealed, and from whom the Church received the
        doctrine she preached<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href=
        "#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a>. But
        since the heretics appealed to tradition as interpreting Scripture,
        he likewise appeals to it in the second, third, and fourth
        chapters<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href=
        "#note_75"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a>; and
        having shown that it is totally adverse to the heretical doctrine, he
        returns to the argument from Scripture<a id="noteref_76" name=
        "noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a>, and
        carries it on by quotations briefly from the Old Testament, and more
        fully from the words of the evangelists and apostles, showing, to the
        end of the fifteenth chapter, that they knew but one God, and from
        thence to the end of the twenty-second chapter, that they taught but
        one Jesus Christ, truly God and truly man. The twenty-third is a
        refutation of Tatian's opinion, that Adam was not saved; and the two
        last contain sundry general reflections.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our author had
        confined himself in the third book for the most part to the testimony
        of evangelists and apostles; he informs us, that his object in the
        fourth is to show that our Lord himself testified of only one God,
        his Father, the maker and governor of the world, the author of the
        old and new covenants, and the judge of all mankind<a id="noteref_77"
        name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a>. He does
        not carry on his argument with much regularity, and it would be
        difficult to give any useful analysis of it. But he discusses,
        towards the end, in chapters thirty-seven, thirty-eight, and
        thirty-nine, the great question of the accountability of man, and the
        freedom of the will.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the preface to
        the fifth book<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href=
        "#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a>, he
        announces his intention of carrying on the argument by quotations
        from the writings of the apostle Paul, to show that the same God who
        had spoken to Abraham and given the law had in the latter days sent
        his Son to give salvation to human flesh; which he pursues in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039"
        id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the first eighteen chapters,
        dwelling particularly on the doctrine of the resurrection of the
        flesh (chap. 7-14), and corroborating S. Paul's doctrine from other
        parts of Scripture. He is thence led to the object and end of the
        scheme of salvation by Christ, and the opposition to it by Satan
        (chap. 19-24), especially the great opposition to it through the
        agency of antichrist (chap. 24-30), and passes from the notice of the
        state of departed souls (chap. 31) to exhibit and confirm his opinion
        of the terrestrial reign of Christ and the righteous (chap. 32-35),
        concluding with the consummation of all things in the eternal
        felicity of the just.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen by
        this slight sketch that the former part of the treatise is by far the
        most regular; and for this sufficient reason, that it was more
        completely studied and digested before it was written. In the latter
        books, he adheres but imperfectly to the intention announced in the
        preface, and introduces much matter which was evidently suggested
        casually as he was writing, by some word or expression he found
        himself using.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The work, as I
        have said, was written in Greek; but the greater portion of the
        original has been lost. What remains has been preserved by various
        authors in the form of quotations. In this way two-thirds of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg 040]</span><a name="Pg040"
        id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the first book have come down
        to us; a few detached fragments in the latter half of the second;
        considerably larger and more numerous portions of the third; very
        little of the fourth, but copious extracts from the fifth, especially
        near the beginning. The whole, however, existed in the ninth century,
        as we learn from the testimony of Photius<a id="noteref_79" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        although we have lost the greater part of the original, an ancient
        Latin translation of the whole work has been preserved to us. The
        precise antiquity of this version we are unable to ascertain; but the
        closeness with which Tertullian appears to follow it in many
        passages<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href=
        "#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        particular his making the very same <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> mistakes as the interpreter, (as for instance,
        in regard to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name=

        id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> that he had read that version. That it existed
        in the time of S. Augustin, is certain, as he quotes it at least
        twice, almost word for word<a id="noteref_81" name="noteref_81" href=
        "#note_81"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The effect of this
        great work appears to have been decisive, for we hear no more of any
        eminent person who held the Gnostic opinions. They prevailed to a
        certain degree for the greater part of another century, but they did
        not make head again. The name, indeed, continued to have so great a
        charm, that Clement of Alexandria took it from the heretics, and
        applied it to an intelligent Christian, whom he depicts as the only
        true Gnostic. But the system, as a whole, became so entirely extinct
        that scarce a trace of its influence remains, except in the writings
        of those who had to combat it.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In his opposition
        to the Gnostics, Irenæus had to combat a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">heresy</span></em>;
        the next circumstance which brought him forward was, a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">schism</span></em>
        which threatened to separate a portion of the Christian world from
        the communion of its most influential Church. There had been a
        variation in very early times, and indeed from the beginning, between
        the Churches of Asia Minor, Syria, and Mesopotamia on the one hand,
        and the rest of the Christian world on the other, in regard to the
        keeping of Easter;—other Churches uniting in keeping Easter-day on a
        Sunday, whilst the Christians of those countries kept it at the
        Jewish passover, on whatever day of the week it happened to
        fall<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a>. The
        inconvenience had been felt in the time of S. Polycarp, who
        sojourning in Rome in the time of its bishop Anicetus, they
        endeavoured <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg
        045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        each to persuade the other to embrace the practice he followed. But
        their conferences were without any other effect than to cause both
        parties to agree to differ in peace<a id="noteref_83" name=
        "noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a>. But
        Victor, who succeeded Eleutherus in the see of Rome, viewed the
        matter in a different light. He had no doubt felt the inconvenience
        of this diversity of practice when Blastus endeavoured to raise a
        schism in Rome on this very point<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84"
        href="#note_84"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">84</span></span></a>. He
        therefore conceived the idea of using his influence, as the bishop of
        the principal Church <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg
        046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in
        the world, to bring all Christians to one uniform rule. For this
        purpose he wrote to certain<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href=
        "#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a> leading
        bishops in Asia, requesting them to convene synods of the
        neighbouring bishops, in order to come to an agreement; which was
        done accordingly; and they all, with the exception of the Churches
        above mentioned, wrote circular letters to the whole catholic Church,
        affirming that with them the apostolical tradition was, not to break
        their paschal fast until the Sunday. Eusebius particularly
        mentions<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href=
        "#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a> the
        dioceses in Gaul under the superintendence of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Irenæus as having agreed upon such a
        synodical letter, which he asserts was in existence in his time. So
        far, Victor was successful; and, probably upon the strength of the
        almost universal agreement of the Churches, he appears to have held
        out some threat to those of Asia Minor<a id="noteref_87" name=
        "noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a>, unless
        they thought proper to conform to the general practice. This,
        however, they absolutely refused to do; maintaining that their region
        abounded with relics of apostles and martyrs, and that they preserved
        a tradition purer than that of any other Church, and more consonant
        with the Scriptures. This reply so incensed Victor, that he forthwith
        issued letters, announcing that the Asiatic brethren were cut off
        from the common unity of Christians<a id="noteref_88" name=
        "noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>. Here,
        however, he was not followed by those who had previously agreed with
        him; and Irenæus in particular, in the name of the Christians in Gaul
        under his jurisdiction, wrote both to Victor and to various other
        bishops<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href=
        "#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a>,
        strongly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg
        048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        pressing milder measures, and reminding the Roman prelate of the
        example of Anicetus, one of his predecessors, who paid Polycarp the
        highest honour, even when assured that he would not conform to the
        Western custom, and regarded his own as more apostolical.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What the immediate
        result of these letters was we are not informed by any contemporary
        writer. Anatolius, indeed, (if the Latin version of his Treatise on
        the Paschal Cycle, published by Bucherius, is to be relied on,)
        asserts that Victor did not persist in his excommunication<a id=
        "noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a>; and we
        know subsequently<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href=
        "#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a>
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049"
        id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that many Churches in Asia
        adhered to the Jewish reckoning, and yet were not on that account
        regarded with any aversion by their brethren; and it was not until
        the council of Nice that their bishops there assembled agreed to
        follow the general custom<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92" href=
        "#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a>,—to
        which, however, many persons did not conform in the time of
        Chrysostom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The part which the
        bishop of Rome took in this matter requires perhaps a more explicit
        notice. It has, no doubt, been felt that Victor acted in a manner
        which countenances the claims set up by the popes of later days; but
        when we come to examine, we shall find that whatever claims he
        advanced, beyond what we should allow, were discountenanced by the
        then catholic Church. He did, or attempted to do, two things: first,
        to bring the whole Church <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg
        050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to
        one practice in the observance of the feast of Easter; secondly, when
        he did not succeed with some Churches, to excommunicate the
        dissentients.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first was
        laudable; inasmuch as Christians who travelled upon business, or
        removed their residence from one part of Christendom to another, had
        their feelings disturbed by finding their brethren celebrating so
        important a festival on a different day from that to which they were
        accustomed; and some weak or factious minds were thus tempted to make
        divisions in Churches to which they removed. This had been
        particularly the case in the Church of Rome, as being a place of
        general resort; and therefore Victor, both on that account, and as
        bishop of the principal Church in the world, very rightly exerted
        himself to bring about uniformity. The course he took was also a good
        one. He wrote to the principal bishops in various countries, to
        request them to call synods of the neighbouring bishops, that thus he
        might ascertain the sense of the catholic Church. Nothing could be
        more prudent or temperate; nor was anything apparently better
        calculated to persuade the minority, than to find one consenting
        custom in so many Churches, in countries separated so entirely from
        each other.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now so far we have
        no claim set up inconsistent <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> with the station of influence and dignity which
        we readily concede to have appertained to the Roman bishops from very
        early times; and which, if not most grossly abused, would never have
        been denied to them. Some<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href=
        "#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> have
        supposed that he, with his letters, issued a threat of
        excommunicating those Churches which refused to comply with the
        western custom; but that is opposed to the sequel of the history,
        from which we learn that such a threat would have called forth
        remonstrances, of which in this stage of the business we hear
        nothing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having received
        letters from every quarter except from Asia Minor, stating that the
        traditional custom was the same as that of Rome, he then, instead of
        proceeding by persuasion, immediately conceived the idea of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">compelling</span></em> the dissentient Churches
        to comply with his wishes, by threatening to cut them off from
        communion if they declined. His threat had no effect, and he
        proceeded to put it into execution, nothing doubting that the
        Churches who had been with him hitherto would still stand by him. And
        this is the point at which we encounter something like the modern
        papal claims; for he declared the Churches of Asia Minor cut off, not
        only from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">his</span></em> communion, but from the common
        unity<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href=
        "#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>. Some

        kind can be shown, we have no need to suppose any ground but a strong
        desire of a rash and determined mind to carry the point he had
        undertaken. Be the ground what it may, <em class=

        Irenæus in particular represented to him the difference between his
        spirit and that of his predecessors. And so entirely abortive was his
        attempt, that, as we have seen, about sixty years after, Firmilian,
        in his letter to Cyprian<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href=

        expressly asserted that the peace and unity of the Catholic Church
        had never been broken by differences about the observance of Easter
        or other religious rites: and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">that</span></em>, in alluding to the conduct of
        Stephen, bishop of Rome, who had quarrelled with the African bishops
        because their custom differed from the Roman on the subject of
        rebaptizing those who had been baptized by heretics; which would
        necessarily have brought to mind any schism produced by Victor, a
        previous bishop of Rome, if any such had been produced.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, then, we

        Apostles' times, had decided against the power of the bishop of Rome
        to cut off whom he might think fit from the common unity; not that
        they knew nothing of such a claim, but that <em class=

        one, that his remains are not very considerable in extent, and the
        other, that they are chiefly occupied in doctrinal controversy. What,

        This subject, amongst others, our author states to have been
        discussed between them, and that Polycarp rested his adherence to the
        Jewish practice upon his having always kept Easter in that way with
        St. John and the other Apostles, and consequently declined to change
        it; whereupon, to show that this inflexibility had produced no breach
        of amity, Anicetus thought proper to request Polycarp to officiate
        for him, and to take his place at the holy communion<a id=

        id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of which his mention of it is
        a powerful testimony.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He speaks of the
        Church of Rome not only as having been founded and settled under its
        first bishop by St. Peter and St. Paul, but as being one of the
        greatest and most ancient, well known to all men<a id="noteref_138"
        name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class=

        preserving the true doctrine by the resort of persons from all
        quarters, and possessing from this circumstance a more powerful
        pre-eminence; and states that all Churches must on that account
        resort to it<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href=
        "#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a>. It is
        well known that this is a passage upon which Romanists very much
        rely, as establishing the claim of their Church to be the mistress of
        controversies to all Christendom; and I have chosen to give it the
        utmost force of which it is fairly capable, in order to avoid the
        charge of slurring it over, and in order to show that even thus it
        states nothing inconsistent with the doctrine of the Church of
        England respecting the present Church of Rome. I will therefore give
        a translation of the passage, which appears below, and make some
        remarks upon that translation:—<span class="tei tei-q">“For every
        Church (that is, the faithful who are on all sides,) must on account
        of its more powerful <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg
        064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        pre-eminence resort to this Church, in which the apostolical
        tradition is preserved by those who are on all sides.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are several
        words in this passage which must influence the sense of it. The first
        I shall notice is the word <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">potentiorem</span></span>, the more especially
        as there is a various reading upon it. One MS. (the Clermont) of
        considerable value, reads <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign"
        xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">potiorem</span></span>; but Massuet, who
        examined it, says that it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">had</span></em> been written <span lang="la"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">pontiorem</span></span> (but altered to
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">potiorem</span></span>,) which is almost
        certainly a contraction for the common reading. We must therefore, I
        conclude, sit down with the common reading; although Massuet, in the
        Benedictine edition, and J. J. Griesbach, in some remarks upon this
        passage<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href=
        "#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a>, prefer
        the other. But what Greek word <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">potentiorem</span></span> represents must be
        matter of conjecture; and no one who is acquainted with the manner in
        which the translator has rendered Greek words will be inclined to lay
        much stress upon it. It may have been put for ἱκανωτέραν, or
        κρείττονα; or, in short, the comparative of any adjective which
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">admits</span></em> of being rendered <span lang=
        "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">potens</span></span>. We then come to the word
        <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">principalitatem</span></span>. This we know that
        the ancient translator of Irenæus uses to signify ἀρχή<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">141</span></span></a>.
        Putting these two together, Griesbach <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class=

        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=

        of the idea of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        no need of this. <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=

        know that all the apostolical sees had a kind of <em class=

        "font-style: italic">principality</span></em> or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=

        other Churches equally ancient with themselves. Nay, we know that the
        Church of Rome had at that time, in point of fact, a more powerful
        pre-eminence than any other Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next word to
        be considered is <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">convenire</span></span>, which
        may be rendered either <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">agree</span></em>;
        and I confess I should have been disposed, with Massuet, to render it
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">agree</span></em>, were it not for a perfectly
        parallel passage in the 32d <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Oration</span></span> of Gregory of Nazianzum,
        delivered at the first council of Constantinople. Speaking of
        Constantinople, he says, εἰς ἣν τὰ πανταχόθεν ἄκρα συντρέχει, καὶ
        ὅθεν ἄρχεται ὡς ἐμπορίου κοινοῦ τῆς πίστεως. Here Constantinople is
        spoken of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">then</span></em> under the very same terms as
        Rome by Irenæus, as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        other parts of the Christian world are said to <span class=

        "font-style: italic">resort from all quarters</span></em>: συντρέχει
        πανταχόθεν. Are not these words an exact parallel to the <span lang=
        "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">convenire</span></span> and <span lang="la"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">undique</span></span> of the translator of
        Irenæus? I therefore feel bound to give <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">convenire</span></span> the sense of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">resort</span></em>.
        The next word to be noticed is <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">undique</span></span>, the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">application</span></em> of which is disputed;
        some, as Barrow<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href=
        "#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a> and

        applying it only to the immediate neighbourhood of Rome, i. e. Italy
        and the adjacent parts of Gaul; others, and of course the Romanists,
        to the whole Christian Church. According to the former plan, the
        clause <span class="tei tei-q">“hoc est ... fideles”</span> is a
        limitation of the expression <span class="tei tei-q">“omnem
        ecclesiam,”</span> confining it to the Churches immediately
        surrounding Rome; and consequently the pre-eminence of the Church of
        Rome would be equally narrowed by this interpretation of <span lang=
        "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">undique</span></span>. I am far from contending
        that this interpretation is not correct; and the very fact of the
        passage admitting it, without any force whatever, shows how little
        the papal cause can be made to rest upon it. But as Gregory, in the
        parallel <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg
        067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        passage I have quoted, uses the term πανταχόθεν, I am disposed to
        take <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">undique</span></span> as its
        representative; the more especially as we have seen that, whatever
        influence it gives to Rome, the selfsame influence had Constantinople
        in an after age.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are one or
        two more words still to be mentioned. <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Necesse est</span></span> is one of them. It may
        imply that it is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">duty</span></em> of every Church to resort to
        Rome; but its more natural and usual meaning is, that, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as a matter of
        course</span></em>, Christians from all parts, and not strictly the
        Churches themselves, were led to resort thither by the superior
        eminence of that Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have hitherto
        taken this passage as though it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">must</span></em> be applied definitely to the
        Church of Rome. But this is by no means necessary; for it may be a
        general observation applicable to all the most eminent Churches, as
        may be seen by the following translation and arrangement of
        it:—<span class="tei tei-q">“For every Church, (that is, the faithful
        all around,) must necessarily resort to that Church in which the
        apostolical tradition has been preserved by those on all sides of it,
        on account of its more powerful pre-eminence;”</span> that is,
        Christians must have recourse each to the most ancient and most
        eminent Church in his neighbourhood. And this agrees with a passage
        of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name=
        "Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Tertullian<a id=
        "noteref_148" name="noteref_148" href="#note_148"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">148</span></span></a>, in
        which he refers southern Greeks to Corinth, northern to Philippi and
        Thessalonica, Asiatics to Ephesus, Italians and Africans to Rome. The
        only objection which occurs to me lies in the word <span lang="la"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hanc</span></span>, which, if the passage is to
        be taken in this application, must be translated <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>; but
        as it was in all probability the representative of ταύτην, this word
        can scarcely present any difficulty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I will close this
        whole discussion with two remarks; first, that unless we could
        recover the Greek text of this passage, it is plainly impossible to
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ascertain</span></em> its true sense; and
        secondly, that the strongest sense we can attach to it, consistently
        with history, is, that Christians of that period from all parts of
        Christendom must, if they wish to ascertain traditions, have recourse
        to the Church of Rome, because, as the first Church in Christendom,
        the common traditions were preserved there by the resort of
        Christians from all quarters. This twofold reason for resorting
        thither has long ceased to exist, and consequently this passage of
        Irenæus can afford no support to the claims of modern Rome, until it
        can be proved that those portions of the Christian world which are
        not in communion with her are no part of the Catholic
        Church.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is another
        subject which has caused much discussion, which is adverted to by
        Irenæus, viz. the miraculous powers of the Church. He declares that
        in his time powers of this kind were possessed by Christians, such as
        raising the dead<a id="noteref_149" name="noteref_149" href=
        "#note_149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">149</span></span></a>, and
        casting out devils, and healing the sick; that they likewise had the
        gift of prophecy<a id="noteref_150" name="noteref_150" href=
        "#note_150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">150</span></span></a>, and
        spoke with tongues, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page070">[pg
        070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        revealed secret things of men and mysteries of God<a id="noteref_151"
        name="noteref_151" href="#note_151"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a>. It is
        well known that Gibbon and Middleton have thrown doubt upon the
        miraculous powers of the primitive Church; and one of their chief
        arguments is that the early writers, such as Irenæus, content
        themselves with general statements, but bring no specific instance.
        The subject has been very fully entered into by the present highly
        learned and amiable bishop of Lincoln, Dr. Kaye, in his work on
        Tertullian<a id="noteref_152" name="noteref_152" href=
        "#note_152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">152</span></span></a>; and in
        the general I am disposed to acquiesce in the theory adopted by the
        bishop, that those powers were conferred only by apostolical hands,
        and that of course they would continue till all that generation was
        extinct who were contemporary with St. John, the last of the
        Apostles. That would admit of Irenæus having known instances; and not
        having any idea that the power was to be extinct, he would think that
        it still remained, even if he had not known any <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recent</span></em>
        instances. It is necessary to remark, however, that he speaks of the
        gifts of tongues and the revealing of secrets and mysteries, not as a
        thing coming under his own knowledge, but heard of from others; and
        it does not appear that he intends to say that they continued to his
        own time. And I will venture to observe that it appears rather unfair
        to Irenæus to set <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg
        071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        aside his testimony by saying that he brings no specific instance of
        those things which he speaks of as still done. He might feel that the
        thing was so notorious, that those who were not convinced by the
        notoriety of such occurrences would cavil at any particular case he
        might select; and his mentioning that some of those who had been
        delivered from evil spirits had become converts, that some of those
        who had been raised from the dead, being poor, had been assisted with
        money<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href=
        "#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        that some had lived many years after<a id="noteref_154" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        indicates that he was speaking from a knowledge of individual cases.
        One should indeed have expected that every one who owed his
        deliverance from Satanic possession to the miraculous power possessed
        by Christians would have embraced the faith of those who exercised
        it; and the circumstance that Irenæus affirms this of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> only
        gives a greater air of probability to his whole statement. Besides
        this, we must distinguish between the cases of persons healed by the
        direct agency of an individual, and those in which it pleased God to
        hear the joint prayers of several; for it is observable that our
        author attributes the raising of the dead only to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the united prayers and fasting of a whole
        Church, and confines it to cases of great urgency<a id="noteref_155"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The testimony
        which Irenæus bears to the relation between the Church and the empire
        is but slight. He mentions a Christian as having been in his own
        youth high in the imperial court, at the same time that he was a
        follower or admirer of Polycarp<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156"
        href="#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a>; he
        speaks of Christians in the imperial palace deriving an income from
        the heathen, and able to assist their poorer brethren<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a>; and he
        acknowledges the general advantages which Christians derived from the
        supremacy of the Romans, in common with their other subjects, in the
        prevalence of peace and the freedom from individual outrage<a id=

        mentions very distinctly the persecutions at another time Christians
        suffered (particularly alluding to those which took place at Lyons),
        and notices that slaves were compelled to inform against their
        masters; and that in this way the calumny that Christians fed upon
        human flesh arose, from a misunderstanding of the nature of the holy
        Eucharist<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is remarkable
        how strictly this notion of an external, visible, ascertainable body,
        consisting of individuals, and under the government of individual
        officers, having a personal succession in distinct localities<a id=
        "noteref_183" name="noteref_183" href="#note_183"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        accordance with the doctrine of the Church of England; and how
        totally opposed it is to the notions held amongst dissenters, and by
        individuals within the Church in modern times. According to Irenæus,
        moreover, the different classes of sectaries would be regarded as
        having neither spiritual life nor the Holy Spirit, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">except</span></em> so
        far as they might be supposed to be in communion with the body
        governed by elders or bishops descended from the Apostles. If in any
        way or to any degree they can be supposed to be in communion with
        them, to that extent they would be thought to have the Holy Ghost,
        and to be in the way of life, but no further. I am not now discussing
        whether he was right or wrong; I am merely pointing out the
        contrariety between his views of the Church and those which appear to
        be most popular at present. I doubt if most Protestants would not
        pronounce his doctrine to be gross <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> bigotry; for very many of those who would go so
        far with him as to acknowledge the Church to be a visible society,
        would be very far from restricting the grace of the Holy Spirit to
        the communion of the bishops in succession from the Apostles.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I must, however,
        direct more particular attention to one part of his system which did
        not require to be brought out prominently. We have seen that he
        thought it possible for the Church to lose whole members. In fact,
        although he thought that the truth was kept up by the succession of
        bishops <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">throughout the Church</span></em>, and that it
        was a mark of truth to be so kept up, he still believed that
        presbyters or bishops might, through pride, or other evil motives,
        make schisms in the Church<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184"
        href="#note_184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a>; and he
        taught that those were to be adhered to who, with the succession,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081"
        id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> keep the Apostles' doctrine,
        and lead good lives<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href=
        "#note_185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a>;
        implying, of course, that some who were in the succession might
        depart from the Apostles' doctrine. The succession was not,
        therefore, in his opinion, an infallible test of truth in the
        individual Church. Any individual Church, or even a considerable
        number or collection of Churches, might fall into heresy, and thus
        become cut off from the Church; but it is evident that he did not
        think this possible to happen to the great body of the Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is manifest
        from this that he thought the private Christian must sometimes pass
        judgment upon his bishop, and might be called upon to separate from
        him, and to adhere to those who were more orthodox. In what cases
        this was requisite, or what was to be the extent of the alienation,
        he does not give any hint; but this clearly establishes that he
        thought private judgment upon religious controversy to be sometimes a
        duty: for without the exercise of private judgment upon the part of
        the layman, it would be in some cases impossible for him to show his
        preference for those bishops who adhered to the Apostles'
        doctrine.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg
        082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find no trace
        in Irenæus of any authority in the Church of Rome to decide
        controversies for the rest of the Church. On the contrary, he taught
        Christians to have recourse to any ancient apostolical Church, or
        rather collection of Churches<a id="noteref_186" name="noteref_186"
        href="#note_186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a>, if
        they wished to ascertain the traditional system of the Church. He
        indeed quotes that Church as being in his time a more important
        witness to the truth than any other individual Church, because,
        through the continual concourse of Christians thither, in consequence
        of its more powerful pre-eminence, the traditions of the universal
        Church were there collected as it were into a focus<a id=
        "noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        as I have pointed out elsewhere<a id="noteref_188" name="noteref_188"
        href="#note_188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a>, he
        recognises no authority in that Church to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">claim</span></em> to
        decide controversies. With him it is not any individual Church that
        is commissioned to preserve the truth, not even the Church of
        Jerusalem, which he calls the mother of all Churches (a title which
        has been since arrogated by the Roman Church), but the Catholic
        Church, truly so called, by the mouth of her pastors throughout the
        world; for although he mentions the pre-eminence of the Church of
        Rome in his day as a matter of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fact</span></em>, he does not <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> state it to be a matter of <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em>;
        nor does he ground any thing upon it but the further fact that it
        followed, of course, that Christians resorted to it from all
        quarters, as they did afterwards to Constantinople. He gives no hint
        as to the source of that pre-eminence, other than its having been
        settled by the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">two</span></em> Apostles St. Peter and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">St.
        Paul</span></em>, and honoured with being the scene of their
        martyrdom<a id="noteref_189" name="noteref_189" href=
        "#note_189"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">189</span></span></a>. And
        his appeal to it he builds, not on any authority residing in it, but
        upon the fact that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">at that time</span></em> the confluence from all
        parts of the Church caused the tradition of the whole Church to be
        best preserved there, as was afterwards the case at Constantinople,
        and has since been no where. So that his appeal to Rome is not in
        fact an appeal to that Church, but to the Church universal; and since
        Rome has ceased to be the place of resort to the universal Church,
        the ground for appealing to her has ceased likewise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the subject of
        the Bishops of the primitive Church several questions have arisen,
        and it is of course highly desirable to know whether Irenæus
        furnishes any evidence on either side of them. It is not to be
        expected that we can discuss any of them <em class=

        the aid of any single writer; but such indications as we meet with
        may with propriety be drawn out.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That which first
        demands our notice is whether Bishops existed, as a distinct order
        from Presbyters, from the beginning.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now Irenæus does
        undoubtedly call the same persons by the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">name</span></em> of
        Bishops and Presbyters interchangeably. But it has been long ago
        pointed out that the circumstance of the same <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">name</span></em>
        being borne by persons holding two different offices, proves nothing.
        It is unsafe to infer from the circumstance that <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">bishops</span></em>
        are called <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">presbyters</span></em>, or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">presbyters
        bishops</span></em>, that therefore there was not a permanent officer
        set over the other presbyters, and endued with functions which they
        could not exercise, although not at first distinguished by a specific
        name.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other hand,
        we learn from him that there were to be found in every part of the
        Christian world bishops or presbyters placed at the head of Churches,
        which from their importance, must have had other presbyters in them,
        and which we know from other sources to have had other presbyters in
        them; that there was only one of these at one and the same time; that
        they were intrusted with the government of the Churches, and called
        the Bishops of those Churches; that the authority of the office was
        handed down from individual to individual; and that the individuals
        who filled this office, and by consequence <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the office itself, were appointed by inspired
        apostles<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href=
        "#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a>. All
        these facts are irreconcileable with the hypothesis that all
        presbyters were equal in authority and function.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question
        whether these bishops and presbyters might not have been simply
        pastors of independent congregations, is answered by finding that
        they had other presbyters under them, (as Irenæus under Pothinus, and
        Florinus and Blastus under the Bishops of Rome,) and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> in
        places such as Rome, where there were probably more congregations
        than one.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is nothing
        in Irenæus to favour the idea that the subject-presbyters were not
        properly clergymen; on the contrary, the letter of the martyrs to
        Eleutherius would appear to speak of Irenæus as a clergyman, when we
        at the same time know him to have been a presbyter: and it does
        appear in the highest degree improbable that the flourishing Church
        of Rome, which we know to have been the place of residence of two
        Apostles at once, should have been left, down to Irenæus's time, with
        only a single clergyman in it, which must have been the case upon
        this theory; to say nothing of Smyrna, which, according to the same
        scheme, must have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg
        086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        been left destitute of spiritual superintendence during Polycarp's
        visit to Rome, which S. Irenæus has recorded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But granting the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">existence</span></em> of Bishops such as we have
        them now, and their appointment by Apostles, another question arises,
        first suggested, so far as we know, by S. Jerome, whether the powers
        now exclusively reserved to Bishops, such as ordination and
        government, were so exclusively delegated to them by the Apostles, as
        that those powers exercised by other presbyters are invalid. The
        question does not appear to have occurred to Irenæus: but we have no
        hint in him of other presbyters having the same authority as the
        bishops of the Churches; on the other hand, he expressly states that
        the Apostles committed the Churches to the government and teaching of
        individual bishops or presbyters in each, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">making them their
        successors, and giving them their own office</span></em><a id=
        "noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a>. And
        the very circumstance of their committing the Churches to those
        individuals did (by what appears to me inevitable consequence)
        exclude all others from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">the same place</span></em> to which those
        individuals were appointed, and constitute them an order by
        themselves. And that the universal Church understood the appointment
        in that sense is proved by the fact, recorded by Irenæus, that the
        succession of authority <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg
        087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was
        kept up in individuals down to his time; the evident implication
        being that it was so in all Churches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The evidence,
        therefore, supplied by Irenæus, although not enabling us, <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by
        itself</span></em>, to discuss the whole question fully, is in
        support of the discipline of the Church of England, which refuses to
        recognize the ordinations of any but bishops, properly so called, and
        having their authority in succession from the Apostles<a id=

        Trinity.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The controversy
        which Irenæus carried on with the Gnostics being directly and
        explicitly on the subject of the Divine Nature, led him to treat
        distinctly of the divinity and humanity of Christ and his
        incarnation, of the providential government of God, and his various
        manifestations. He is thus led, almost of necessity, to enunciate the
        doctrine of the Trinity in Unity in various aspects, but most
        especially in regard to the twofold nature of Christ.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In direct
        reference to the doctrine of the Trinity in Unity, he describes the
        agency of the three Persons in the creation of man; the Father
        willing and commanding, the Son ministering and forming, the Spirit
        sustaining and nourishing him<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193"

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a>. So
        again he declares that God made all things by his Word <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or Son, and Wisdom or Spirit, using the

        href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a>. And
        again, in explaining God's dispensations in regard to man, he
        affirms<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href=
        "#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a> that
        God was seen under the Old Testament by the Spirit of prophecy, that

        that he will be seen in his character of Father in the kingdom of
        heaven; and that in this way the Spirit in the Son prepares man, and
        the Son brings him to the Father, and the Father grants to him
        immortality: and so again in the work of man's redemption<a id=

        Spirit operates, the Son supplies, the Father approves, and man is
        perfected to salvation. He likewise gives two statements of the
        substance of the Creed, in which the three Persons of the Trinity are
        spoken of in the same manner as in the Nicene Creed, both of which
        will be given in a subsequent chapter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are all the

        be capable of transgressing; and that, indeed, otherwise excellence
        would not have been either pleasant or an object of desire, because

        into; and that we ought to consider what it has pleased him to reveal

        propagated in the world, we have next to notice the Divine plans for
        its counteraction and removal; and as Irenæus was opposing the
        Gnostic notion that the whole government of the world, prior to the
        Gospel, was in the hands of beings adverse to the Supreme Being, he
        was naturally led to show that, on the contrary, the whole history of
        mankind has been a series of dispensations emanating from one and the

        from the same God acting differently under different circumstances.
        The abolition of the law, he contended, was no proof of a change of
        mind, but only of a change of circumstances; the law being in its

        and the Dragon, as part of the book of Daniel, and the book of Baruch
        as a continuation of that of Jeremiah. There is, in fact, great
        reason to think that he believed in the inspiration (in some sense)

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I argue thus on
        the supposition that his single authority is appealed to. If he is

        agree in receiving a canon of the Old Testament much more like ours
        than like that of Rome. It is true that Origen adds the Maccabees,
        but he states that they are not in the canon. Athanasius, Epiphanius,
        and the Council of Laodicea reckon Baruch as part of the book of
        Jeremiah; Athanasius and the Council add the epistle of Jeremiah;
        Athanasius alone reckons Susanna and Bel and the Dragon. On the other
        hand, they all, together with Gregory of Nazianzum, Jerome, and

        that Christians and Nazoræi agreed in receiving the Jewish books, so
        that he could not have been aware that the Jews did not admit Baruch.
        So that how many soever may agree in <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quoting</span></em>
        the apocryphal books, the weight of authority is clearly against

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From all that has
        been said, it must be clear that we can make but little use of
        Irenæus in settling the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        number of books and of passages which he has quoted, he is of great

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is curious that

        appears, however, that the Gnostics did in fact quote, at least when
        arguing with Christians, the self-same books which we now have; for
        all the passages of Scripture which Irenæus brings forward as
        perverted by them correspond with our present copies.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Irenæus was of
        opinion that the whole of the sacred books of the Old Testament were
        lost during the Babylonish captivity, and that Ezra restored them by
        divine inspiration<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He likewise fully
        believed the fable of Aristeas concerning the translation of the
        Septuagint by the direction of one of the Ptolemies, whom he names
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the son of

        does not relate it with all the particularity of Josephus; but he
        relates the separation of the seventy interpreters from each other,
        and their miraculous agreement in the same words and phrases from
        beginning to end. It is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg
        135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        clear, therefore, that he believed in the inspiration of the
        Septuagint, so far as it is a translation of the Hebrew; and no
        wonder that he was unable to avoid extending the same feeling to the
        other books which commonly accompany the translated portion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He likewise
        mentions Theodotion of Ephesus, and Aquila of Pontus, both Jewish
        proselytes, as having wrongly translated Isaiah vii. 14<a id=

        Theodotion was the contemporary of Irenæus, and must have published
        his version so recently, that it is wonderful that Irenæus should
        have seen it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lastly, he
        mentions and distinguishes between the genuine and ancient copies of
        the Scriptures and the incorrect ones<a id="noteref_325" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having noticed all
        the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">external</span></em> matter, let us come to the
        opinions of Irenæus in regard to the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">use and
        value</span></em> of the holy Scriptures, and the method of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">understanding</span></em> them. Although here
        his example is more forcible than his precepts, it is satisfactory
        that he speaks very definitely, and to the purpose.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For instance, he
        informs us that, after the Apostles had preached the Gospel orally,
        they took care that the substance of their preaching should be put in
        writing, to be the ground and pillar of our faith<a id="noteref_326"
        name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a>. It is
        very remarkable that he should use this very phrase in speaking of
        the Gospel, which St. Paul had used in speaking of the Church itself;
        showing apparently that it was by the custody of the Scriptures that
        the Church was to sustain its office. Indeed he expresses this in so
        many words in another passage, when he says that the truth is
        preserved by the keeping and reading of the Scripture, and preaching
        consistently with it<a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href=
        "#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His own practice
        is perfectly consistent with his principles. When he enters into
        controversy, his first appeal, indeed, in the particular case in
        hand, was to common sense, as showing the extreme absurdity and
        glaring contradiction of the Gnostic <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class=

        href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a>. But as
        they claimed revelation for their authority, he then goes to the
        Scripture, as the only authentic <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">record</span></em> of
        revelation<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href=
        "#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a>; and it
        is evident that, on his own account, he would never have appealed to
        any other authority in support of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">great and leading
        doctrines</span></em> he has to deal with. When he does bring in
        tradition as an independent and collateral <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">witness</span></em>
        of revelation, he does so because the Gnostics themselves appealed to
        tradition<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href=
        "#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a> as
        something more certain than Scripture. And having met them upon this
        ground, he goes on<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href=
        "#note_331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a>, in the
        large remaining portion of his treatise, to refute their systems by
        the induction of passages from the successive portions of the Old and
        New Testaments.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Clearly,
        therefore, his disposition, where the question was what God had
        revealed, would be to go, first of all, and entirely, if possible, to
        Scripture; for whereas the heretics held that the inspired volume was
        obscure and uncertain<a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href=
        "#note_332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        maintained that there were truths contained in it without any doubt
        or obscurity, and that those were the things in which the
        sound-minded and pious would chiefly meditate<a id="noteref_333"
        name="noteref_333" href="#note_333"><span class=

        things which are obscure and doubtful, he taught that we should

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was,
        however, another aid which he looked upon as of the most certain and
        most important utility, so far as it extended, and that was the
        baptismal creed, which he regarded as infallible for leading to the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is obvious that
        he means the bishops of the Churches, who were the chief preachers of
        those times. And it is observable that he does not think the
        succession a perfect guarantee of the truth being preserved,
        otherwise he would not have added the qualifications of sound
        discourse and a holy life. He does not therefore support the idea
        that the truth is necessarily preserved in any one Church by the
        succession, or that any one bishop of any particular Church (the
        Bishop of Rome, for instance,) is capable of deciding the sense of
        Scripture authoritatively. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg
        141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        And, in point of fact, it is only upon <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">fundamentals</span></em> that he recommends an
        appeal to the bishops, as sure to guide the inquirer into truth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is obvious,
        moreover, that, although no doubt God will aid and bless his
        ordinance of the ministry at all times to the faithful soul, yet that
        the aid of one's own particular pastor or bishop must be much less
        capable of settling the mind now that Christ's true pastors are
        opposed to each other, than in the time of Irenæus, when they held
        all together. In his time no such thing had occurred as a bishop of
        Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Rome, or Constantinople, acknowledged
        by general consent to have fallen into great and important error.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In short, we have
        no approach in Irenæus to the idea of an interpreter so infallible as
        shall take away from the private Christian all responsibility but
        that of ascertaining him and following his decisions. He points out
        means of arriving at truth; but he does not speak of them as
        unfailing, except in the case of those foundation truths which are
        now acknowledged by the body of every ancient Church under
        heaven.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was controversy
        which elicited from Irenæus a declaration of his views as to the
        nature and use of tradition. The Gnostics taught a different doctrine
        from the Catholics on the nature and attributes of God, the
        incarnation and life of Christ, and the whole scheme of the divine
        dispensations. Against them he takes up three different lines of
        argument: from common sense, from tradition, and from Scripture. The
        argument from common sense he carries on through the first and second
        books, showing the inconsistencies, contradictions, and absurdities
        of the various Gnostic systems. It is evident, from his own words,
        that it was his intention to rest his remaining argument principally
        on the Scriptures; for in the preface to the third book, in
        announcing the plan of the rest of his work, he says that in that
        book he shall bring forward his proofs from Scripture, without
        mentioning tradition; but since they demurred to its authority,
        asserting<a id="noteref_340" name="noteref_340" href=

        self-contradictory, and, in short, that it was impossible for any to
        learn the truth from it but those who possessed the true <em class=

        "font-style: italic">tradition</span></em>, (which they contended was
        preserved amongst themselves, having been communicated to them
        orally, and being, in fact, that hidden wisdom which had been
        imparted by the Apostles only to the perfect,) Irenæus likewise
        appeals to tradition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot take
        leave of this passage without noticing the extraordinary comments

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He says,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I will take his
        conclusions in their order:—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. So far is
        Irenæus from applauding the Gnostics for <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">admitting</span></em>
        (not the variety of senses which the Scripture may afford, but) the
        inconsistency of different Scriptural statements, that it is evident
        that he is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">blaming</span></em> them for wishing to escape
        from the obvious meaning of Scripture under this pretence. I am not
        saying that he would have denied that various senses of particular
        passages may appear equally natural; but that is not the case as
        between Irenæus and the Gnostics. He is evidently asserting what he
        believes to be written throughout the Scriptures as with a sunbeam,
        and brings in tradition, not to explain the Scripture, but to confirm
        his view of it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. It is very true
        that Irenæus would evidently have gone to tradition to explain the
        obscurities of Scripture, if in any point it could be so explained;
        but that does not appear <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">from this passage</span></em>: on the contrary,
        it is the heretics who are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">here</span></em> for appealing to it, and not to
        such a tradition as he approved, but to one which was capable of no
        proof that it was apostolical. And with regard to the tradition he
        appealed to being an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">unwritten</span></em> tradition; in the first
        place, he does appeal to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">written</span></em> tradition when he can, viz.
        to the epistles of St. Clement and St. Polycarp; and in regard to the
        unwritten tradition which he adduces, the only tradition of that kind
        to which both he and the Romanist writers agree to appeal is
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145"
        id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Baptismal Creed (as will
        be shown presently); for on two of the other points on which he
        adduces a different kind of unwritten tradition, viz. the millenium
        and the age of Christ at his crucifixion, his views are rejected by
        the Roman Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. That primitive
        tradition must originally have been wider than Scripture (at least
        upon points <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not of faith</span></em>), must be true from the
        very nature of the case. But this does not by any means follow from
        Irenæus's distinguishing between Scripture and tradition, because
        what he means is simply this, that the Gnostic tenets were at
        variance with apostolical truth, whether gathered from Scripture or
        handed down by tradition. The traditional truth he brings forward
        against them is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">identical</span></em> with what he deduces from
        the written word.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having shown,
        then, that really apostolical tradition unequivocally opposed the
        Gnostic tenets, he returns again to the Scriptures, and goes on in
        the large remaining portion of his work (which, contrary to his
        intention, spread itself into a fourth, and even a fifth book,) to
        show how inconsistent they were with the Scriptures, first of the
        Old, and afterwards of the New Testament, and how important to our
        salvation those verities were which they impugned.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is perfectly
        evident, therefore, that the mind of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Irenæus naturally went to Scripture, either to
        prove doctrine or to refute error; and that he regarded it as being,
        to all orthodox Christians, the natural standard of appeal. With
        regard to the Gnostics, he evidently thought that they were past
        conviction from either reason, tradition, or Scripture; because,
        whatever criterion was produced, they had something to say against it
        or to turn it aside<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href=
        "#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a>: but to
        single-minded Christians he felt that the written word must be the
        great authority, and arguments drawn from it the most perfectly
        conclusive. He speaks of some things in it as admitting no doubt; he
        points to an obvious aid to the interpretation of ambiguities, by
        calling in plainer things to explain the doubtful; he speaks of the
        New Testament as the ground and pillar of our faith; and he declares
        that the truth is preserved by the keeping, reading, and consistent
        exposition of the Scriptures.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In what way, then,
        does he appeal to tradition? In this part of his work he calls it in
        as establishing the same <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">general</span></em> views, which he confirms
        more at length from Scripture; as preparing the mind to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> believe that the view he takes of
        Scripture is the true one; as a separate and independent witness to
        the selfsame truths which he is preparing to confirm by an adduction
        of multiplied passages of Holy Writ. He does not bring it forward to
        establish any thing not hinted at in the Bible; neither, on the other
        hand, does he bring it forward to show what others had gathered out
        of the Scriptures; but he adduces it as a separate testimony,
        emanating originally from the same source as the Scriptures<a id=
        "noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a>, and
        therefore, so far as it went, a fitting criterion of their
        meaning.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have chosen to
        adduce the opening of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">third</span></em> book first of all, because
        Irenæus enters more professedly there into his motives for appealing
        to tradition; but he had made the appeal, as may have been seen, in
        an early part of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">first</span></em> book<a id="noteref_343" name=
        "noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a>. The
        manner of the appeal is somewhat different in the two places: in the
        first book he appeals to it to show the strong contrast between the
        inconsistencies and contradictions of the Gnostics and the unity and
        consistency of catholic teaching; in the latter, to confirm his own
        views of Scripture. It is true that in both these cases the appeal is
        in some sense of a negative character, i. e. it is for the purpose of
        proving that such and such doctrines are <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> to be
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148"
        id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> received; but in other cases
        he makes a directly positive use of it, viz. to prove particular
        doctrines which do not appear to have been explicitly disputed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What, then, is the
        tradition to which Irenæus assigns this important function? It is

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is obvious,

        substance of the baptismal creed; and thence, perhaps, it may be
        inferred that he would confine tradition altogether to the creed. But
        it must be remembered that, in declining to go to Gnostic tradition,
        and choosing in preference that which is truly apostolical, the
        principle of his appeal is this: that the Apostles delivered the
        doctrines of the Gospel by preaching, &amp;c. to the different
        Churches, and by individual instruction to the particular persons
        whom they made bishops of the Churches; that the bishops had
        delivered down the same mass of truths to the Churches they presided
        over, and to their successors; and that the truth might be

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But we are not
        left to inference alone to learn the views of Irenæus; he instances
        the epistles of Clement and Polycarp as containing true traditions,
        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">they</span></em> exhibit other truths beyond
        those of the creed. Again, the faith, which, if the Apostles had left
        no writings, he affirms must have been kept up by tradition, and
        which was, in fact, kept up in barbarous nations without the aid of
        writing<a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href=
        "#note_355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a>, must
        have been something more extensive than the mere elementary points of
        belief. Nay, his assertion that when we are in doubt, even upon
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">trifling</span></em> points, it is a duty to
        have recourse to the most ancient Churches<a id="noteref_356" name=
        "noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a>, shows
        at once that the province of tradition, in his mind, was far wider
        than the transmission of simply fundamental points; it was a great
        system of doctrine, discipline, and practice, which such an
        observation looked at; and there can be but little doubt that,
        although his subject in his great <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Treatise leads him to adduce it formally, only
        on the subject of doctrine, that he found himself bound by it upon
        all points which appeared to be thus universally handed down in the
        Churches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But then it must
        be confessed that Irenæus stood in a position with regard to this
        tradition very different from that in which we stand. It was a thing
        which lived about him in all the daily intercourse of life, and
        respecting which there was scarcely a possibility of a doubt; whereas
        to us it is a thing which has to be established by evidence, which
        does not come to our minds unsought. It was a thing <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></em>
        which the most unlearned knew thoroughly; for it was the very
        atmosphere in which he breathed: to us learning is required, and
        actual application to the subject. The Church <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></em>
        testified directly to the individual: now we have to ascertain the
        Church's testimony by the further testimony of individuals. It is
        impossible, therefore, that apostolical tradition should have the
        same evidence to men's minds now which it had then; although we may
        think it ought to be reverently followed, wherever and by whomsoever
        it can be ascertained.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, we have
        seen that the medium through which Irenæus believed pure tradition to
        be transmitted was the bishops of the Churches; but it does not
        follow that he thought every bishop, or the <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> bishops of any particular Church, an unerring
        depository of such tradition. He supposed the case of a bishop who
        was in the succession, but yet did not hold fast the Apostles'
        doctrine<a id="noteref_357" name="noteref_357" href=
        "#note_357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">357</span></span></a>, and he
        evidently implies that such a person was not to be adhered to; it is,
        therefore, not any individual bishop, or the bishop of any particular
        see, that he would appeal to, but the aggregate of the bishops of the
        universal Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is remarkable
        how strong is the resemblance between the positions occupied by the
        Gnostics and Irenæus respectively, and those taken up by Romanists
        and the Church of England. Both that ancient father and ourselves
        think Scripture perfectly clear upon the fundamental points to the
        singleminded, go first and last to Scripture upon all doctrinal
        points, and make tradition only auxiliary and subordinate to it. Both
        the Gnostics and the Romanists complain of the insuperable
        difficulties of the Scripture without tradition, and thus make
        tradition practically set aside Scripture; and the tradition they
        appeal to turns out, when examined, to be nothing more nor less than
        their own teaching.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But besides this
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">public</span></em> tradition, extant throughout
        all the Churches, there is another kind of tradition <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he brings forward, viz. that kept up by a
        direct line from the Apostles by the testimony of individuals. This
        he brings forward under various forms of expression, as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I have heard from an elder, who had heard from those who
        had seen and been instructed by the Apostles;”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Wherefore the elders, who are disciples of the Apostles,
        say,”</span> &amp;c.; <span class="tei tei-q">“As the elders, who saw
        John, the Lord's disciple, remember that they heard of him;”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“And all the elders, who associated with
        John, the Lord's disciple, testify that John taught them this; for he
        remained with them down to the time of Trajan.”</span> He appeals to
        it on the subject of Christ's descent into hell<a id="noteref_358"
        name="noteref_358" href="#note_358"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">358</span></span></a>, which
        did not enter into the earliest creeds; on the place of the saints
        departed<a id="noteref_359" name="noteref_359" href=
        "#note_359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a>; on the
        millennium<a id="noteref_360" name="noteref_360" href=
        "#note_360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">360</span></span></a>; as
        well as on the fact that Jesus continued his teaching till past forty
        years of age<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href=
        "#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is evident that
        such testimony, carried down in one chain, unchecked by any other
        similar chain, must be liable to great deterioration. An instance of
        this may be seen in the last-mentioned case in which he quotes this
        kind of evidence; viz. his idea that Jesus continued his teaching
        till past forty years of age<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362"
        href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a>. All
        other writers who speak on the subject are agreed that Irenæus, or
        some person through whom this assertion came, must have made some
        mistake; that our Lord, in fact, began his teaching shortly after his
        baptism, and continued it through three passovers, and no more. And
        yet we have apparently very strong evidence for the assertion of
        Irenæus; for he declares that all the elders who companied with John
        the Apostle affirmed it, and that some of them declared that they had
        it from other Apostles. The probability is, that Irenæus, who was
        quite a youth when acquainted with these persons, had misunderstood
        what he had heard in their conversations with each other, or
        remembered it incorrectly after a long lapse of years, being biassed
        by his own view of a passage of Scripture which he quotes in
        confirmation<a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href=
        "#note_363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a>, and
        which may be the real foundation of the opinion in question.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is likewise
        evident that this tradition in regard to mere facts not connected
        with any important doctrine, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and depending upon the correctness of the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">memory</span></em> of an individual, is of very
        different character from that of important facts and doctrines, and
        points of discipline, kept up publicly in all Christian Churches and
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">witnessed</span></em> to by him as actually
        subsisting in his own day or at the very time of his writing. At the
        same time they may be received, as we receive other historical facts,
        when not contradicted by other evidence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And something of
        the same degree of uncertainty must in like manner hang about the
        transmission of doctrines or opinions by such a channel. And it is to
        be remembered that Irenæus, when he testifies of these, is not in the
        same position as when he speaks of public doctrine, discipline, or
        customs. There he is the witness of the combined teaching of many
        lines of apostolical succession; here, for all that appears, of only
        one: and that one requires to be checked or confirmed by other
        evidence before it can gain our full assent. If what is gained in
        this way fall in with Scripture, or explains or carries out more
        fully the meaning of Scripture in a manner not inconsistent with
        other Scripture, then we may feel that it is to be treasured up, as
        being in all probability a fragment of apostolical tradition. If,
        again, it is confirmed by other sufficient testimony, it may be
        looked upon in the same light, in proportion to the degree of
        evidence: for although Irenæus unquestionably <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> quoted these latter traditions as
        undoubted truths, it is impossible that they should, upon his single
        testimony, appear so to our minds.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is, however,
        one general remark which applies to all the various instances in
        which he appeals to tradition, and that is, that he does not appear
        to have known any thing of a transmitted comment on the text of
        Scripture. The only way in which he applies tradition to the
        interpretation of Scripture is, by laying down certain facts of our
        Lord's history, which were universally acknowledged or handed down by
        sufficient testimony, or certain doctrines of religion or general
        principles which were universally received as of apostolical
        authority, and bringing them forward in confirmation of the views
        which he himself deduced from a comparison and accumulation of
        texts.</p>

        embodying (to a certain extent) Primitive Tradition, it appears
        natural to bring forward in the next place such notices of it as
        Irenæus furnishes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find, then,
        that it was customary at baptism to rehearse to every person the rule

        indeed, was not uniform in language, but the same points appear to
        have been adhered to, and to have been stated in much the same order.
        Irenæus, indeed, does not distinctly copy any creed: but he rehearses
        all the chief points of it in two different passages, which I will
        give at <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name=

        well as the number, or that those who were predestined to have the

        saved eternally: so that the more we examine, the more clear does it

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Who, then, are

        which he speaks of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        this question. In explaining the parable of the vineyard let out to

        commensurate with the visible Church (indeed he knows no other): and
        so he proceeds further on<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href=

        "font-style: italic">We</span></em> who were not as yet were

        And so in another place he speaks of the Church as <span class=

        himself collected by himself<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388"

        and in another passage, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg
        170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the wages of Christ are men collected out of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these passages
        reflect light upon each other, and exhibit the all-wise God as
        planning from eternity the last dispensation, by which He chooses,
        through the Divine Word, to gather out of the world men of all
        nations, and to restore to them the lost gift of immortality, by
        adopting them for his own children, and bestowing on them his Spirit,
        and thus uniting them in the one body of his Church; so that those
        who believe, and continue in obedience to Him, and hold fast his
        teaching, continue his children; whilst those who do not obey Him are
        cut off from Him, and cease to be his children. And as baptism is the
        sign and means of our union with God and the reception of the Holy
        Spirit<a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href=
        "#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a>, so
        baptism is the sign and pledge of this predestination and
        election.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is another
        question as to this election, upon which Irenæus throws but little
        light; that is, whether God has elected into his Church upon foreseen
        faith or not. He expressly declares<a id="noteref_391" name=
        "noteref_391" href="#note_391"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a> that
        God leaves <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg
        171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in
        darkness and unbelief those who, He foresees, will not believe; but
        what is the precise application of that declaration, whether to those
        to whom God vouchsafes no opportunity of becoming acquainted with the
        Gospel, or to those who, living in the hearing of the Gospel, do not
        receive his grace, is by no means clear. And it would be unsafe,
        therefore, to argue that Irenæus believed that God predestines men to
        grace from foreseen faith. The two things may appear to us
        correlative; but we must remember that there had been no controversy
        on the subject, and therefore he cannot be supposed to have weighed
        his language as we should perhaps do at present.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctrine of
        the Church in regard to baptism has afforded less dispute than almost
        any other down to the very times in which we live. It was fully
        recognized by Irenæus, and appears scattered up and down in various
        parts of his writings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He asserts in

        is no room for any equivocal meaning in these passages. It is not
        merely that he speaks, as a thing of course, of infants being
        baptized, (which, by the plain force of words, he manifestly does,)
        but he directly ascribes to them also the new birth, which he asserts
        to be baptism. This testimony in favour of infant <span class=

        which he appears at first sight to deny forgiveness to those who sin
        since the coming of Christ, and thence to give some countenance to
        the idea that wilful sin of Christians cannot be forgiven. What he
        really does say is simply this; that whereas the ancients who sinned
        before the coming of Christ did, when they had the Gospel preached to
        them in the regions below, and believed, receive remission of sins,
        there is no such hope awaiting those who now commit sin. If they die

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can scarcely
        avoid remarking the strict correspondence between the doctrine of
        Irenæus upon this subject and that contained in the formularies of
        the Church of England, particularly in the Baptismal <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Service and the 16th and 27th Articles.
        And it is the more valuable, because it does not appear <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">directly</span></em>
        in the form of a precise statement, but indirectly, as in the
        Scriptures themselves; showing that it pervaded the whole practical
        system with which his mind was imbued. The difficulty in the
        Scriptures unquestionably is, that regeneration is no where in so
        many words affirmed respecting infants, and that there is language,
        as in St. John's first epistle, appearing to restrict it to persons
        capable of actual obedience. Now in Irenæus we find that omission
        supplied, and yet he uses without scruple the same kind of language
        as St. John; showing that in the system he inherited, and that by an
        interval of only one descent from St. John himself, the two things
        which, with our prejudices, are apt to appear inconsistent, were
        parts of one and the same doctrine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Irenæus has
        expressed himself so much more fully on the subject of the holy
        Eucharist than any other writer near his time, that it is not
        wonderful that his opinions should be appealed to by those who have
        entered into the various discussions on the subject. And his language
        has just so much of ambiguity about it as to allow of hanging upon it
        a more exact and positive meaning than he ever thought of. Every
        sentence, and almost every word therefore, requires to be well
        weighed, that we may come at his real meaning. And we must bear in
        mind that he wrote hundreds of years before any controversy had
        arisen on the subject, and consequently is not to be judged of as
        though he had written since.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are two or
        three important passages which bear directly on the subject, and I do
        not know how to do justice to it without giving them at
        length.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg
        178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first I shall
        take is that in the fifth book<a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404"
        href="#note_404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a>, where
        he is combating the Gnostic notion that the flesh is incapable of
        salvation. His words are as follows:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And altogether absurd are they who despise the whole of
        the divine arrangement, and deny the salvation of the flesh, and
        reject its regeneration, saying that it is not capable of
        immortality. But if it is not saved, then the Lord did not redeem us
        by his blood; nor is the cup of the Eucharist the communion of his
        blood, nor the bread which we break the communion of his body. For
        there is no blood, except from veins and flesh, and the rest of man's
        substance, in which the Word of God was truly made. With his blood he
        redeemed us; as also his apostle saith: <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in whom we have
        redemption through his blood, even the remission of sins</span></em>.
        And since we are his members, and are nourished by the creature, and
        he <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name=
        "Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> himself gives us the
        creature, making his sun to rise and sending rain as it pleaseth him,
        he has recognised the cup of the creature for his own blood, with
        which he tinges (δεύει) our blood, and the bread of the creature he
        has ordained to be his own body, by which he strengthens our
        body.</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Since, therefore, both the mingled cup and the created
        bread receive the word of God, and the Eucharist becomes the blood
        and body of Christ, and by these the substance of our flesh gains
        strength and subsists, how can they say that the flesh is not capable
        of the gift of God, which is eternal life, when it is nourished by
        the body and blood of the Lord, and is his member? As St. Paul saith:
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">For we are
        members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones</span></em>: not
        saying these things of some spiritual and invisible man (for the
        spirit has neither flesh nor <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page180">[pg 180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> bones); but concerning the divine work in the
        real man, consisting of flesh and veins and bones; which is also
        nourished from his cup, which is his blood, and is strengthened by
        the bread, which is his body. And as the wood of the vine, bent down
        into the earth, in its proper season bears fruit, and the grain of
        wheat, falling into the earth and becoming dissolved, rises manifold
        through the Spirit of God, which takes in all things; and then,
        through the wisdom of God, having come to the use of men, and having
        received the word of God, becomes the Eucharist, which is the body
        and blood of Christ; so also our bodies, being nourished by it, and
        being deposited in the earth and dissolved in it, will rise again in
        due season, the word of God granting to them resurrection to the
        glory of God, even the Father.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the beginning
        of this passage we have an explicit <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> acknowledgment that it is in some way or
        another in the real body and blood of Christ that we communicate in
        the Eucharist; and I am willing to grant that the whole passage, on a
        cursory reading, might be taken to imply that the bread and wine was
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">changed</span></em> into the literal body and
        blood of Christ; for he appears to speak of our corporeal frames
        being literally sustained by the body and blood of our Lord. But when
        we find him speaking of the necessity of our bodily frames being
        sustained by himself, arising out of the fact that we, even our
        bodies, are his members, we see immediately that, as we cannot be
        literally and corporeally his members, so the change of the bread
        into his body, and that of the wine into his blood, in order to
        nourish our bodies with himself, cannot be a literal and corporeal
        change. And so he does not say that Jesus effected any such change,
        but simply that he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">recognized</span></em> the cup for his blood,
        and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ordained</span></em> the bread to be his
        body<a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405" href=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before I attempt
        to draw out any other of the opinions implied in this passage, I will
        go to another contained in the fourth book<a id="noteref_406" name=
        "noteref_406" href="#note_406"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a>. It is
        this:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Since, therefore, the Church offers with singleness of
        heart, its sacrifice is rightly accounted pure with God. As also Paul
        saith to the Philippians: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">For I am filled with those things which I have
        received from Epaphroditus, which were sent by you, a sweet savour,
        an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God.</span></span> For it
        is our duty to make an offering to God, and in all things to be found
        grateful to God our Maker, offering to him the first fruits of his
        creatures with a pure mind and unfeigned faith, in hope unshaken, in
        fervent charity. And this oblation the Church alone offers pure to
        the Creator, offering to him of his own work with giving of thanks.
        But the Jews <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg
        183]</span><a name="Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> do
        not offer it; for their hands are full of blood; for they did not
        receive the Word, who is offered to God [or through whom the offering
        is made to God], neither indeed do all the assemblies of the
        heretics.... How, indeed, can they feel assured that the bread over
        which thanksgiving is made, is the body of their Lord, and the cup
        that of his blood, if they do not call himself the Son of the Creator
        of the world, that is, his Word, by whom the wood bears fruit, and
        the springs gush forth, and the earth affords first the blade, after
        that the ear, then the full corn in the ear?</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And how, again, can they say that the flesh, which is
        sustained by the body of the Lord and by his blood, turns to
        corruption, and partakes not of life? Either let them alter their
        view, or let them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page184">[pg
        184]</span><a name="Pg184" id="Pg184" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        decline to offer the before-mentioned gifts. But our view harmonizes
        with the Eucharist, and the Eucharist again confirms our view: and we
        offer to him his own, making a corresponding profession of communion
        and union, and acknowledging the resurrection of flesh and spirit.
        For as the bread which comes from the earth, receiving the invocation
        of God, is no longer common bread, but Eucharist, consisting of two
        things, an earthly and a heavenly, so also our bodies, partaking of
        the Eucharist, are no longer corruptible, having the hope of the
        resurrection to eternity. For we offer to him, not as though he
        needed, but giving thanks to his Divine Majesty, and sanctifying the
        work of his hands.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To understand this
        passage more completely, it will be necessary to go back a little.
        Irenæus is showing, contrary to the Gnostic doctrine, that the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page185">[pg 185]</span><a name="Pg185"
        id="Pg185" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Old and New Covenants emanate
        from one and the same God, adopting different methods at different
        periods of the world. He points out, therefore, that the offerings of
        the law of Moses were not intended to be permanent, and that, even
        under the law, God undervalued sacrifice as compared with obedience.
        He then goes on to affirm<a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href=
        "#note_407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a> that
        the prophecy of Malachi that sacrifices should cease, and that
        notwithstanding a pure offering should throughout the world be
        offered to the name of God, was fulfilled in the Eucharist; for he
        informs us that Jesus, <span class="tei tei-q">“instructing his
        disciples to offer to God the first fruits of his creatures (not as
        though he needed, but that they might not be unfruitful or
        ungrateful), took the created thing, bread, and gave thanks, saying,
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘This is my body;’</span> and likewise the
        cup of the earthly creature he acknowledged as his blood, and taught
        them the new offering of the New Testament; which the Church,
        receiving from the Apostles, offers throughout the world to God,—to
        him <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name=
        "Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> who affords us our
        sustenance, the first fruits of his gifts.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here we see very
        distinctly what is the offering which the Church offers in the Lord's
        Supper, viz. the creatures or elements of bread and wine, presented
        as the first fruits of his gifts, and as a thank-offering to him for
        the rest<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href=
        "#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same idea
        appears again in a fragment edited by Pfaff<a id="noteref_409" name=
        "noteref_409" href="#note_409"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">409</span></span></a>:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“For we offer to God the bread and the cup of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187"
        id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> blessing, giving thanks to
        him, because he hath commanded the earth to bring forth fruits for
        our use; and then having performed the offering, we invoke the Holy
        Spirit that he would render this sacrifice, even the bread, the body
        of Christ, and the cup the blood of Christ; so that those who partake
        of these figures may obtain remission of sins and eternal life.
        Those, therefore, who bring these offerings with remembrance of the
        Lord, make no approach to the opinions of the Jews, but, performing a
        spiritual service, shall be called children of wisdom.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is something
        more definite in this passage than in the allusions in the Treatise
        against the Heresies, but the spirit is precisely similar; and it is
        remarkable,—more remarkable than where he is not professing to give
        details, that there is no mention of more than one offering, namely,
        that of the elements, which, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">and which alone</span></em>, are called by the
        name of θυσία.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg
        188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, however, we
        come back to the second passage I have translated, we find one
        clause<a id="noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href=
        "#note_410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a> in
        which there is a various reading, where those which are acknowledged
        to be the best MSS. speak of the Word (i. e. the personal Word, Jesus
        Christ regarded especially in his divine nature,) as <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">offered to
        God</span></em> in the Eucharist, and the Jews are affirmed to be
        incapable of offering the oblation in it because they did not receive
        him. Now it is no doubt possible that Irenæus may have intended to
        speak of a spiritual offering up of our Lord with the oblation, i. e.
        of an offering of it in and through him; but that is all that can be
        implied, for there is no hint whatever of the repetition of the
        sacrifice of atonement for the remission of sins. The <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>
        offering is before the invocation of the Holy Ghost; and it is only
        after that invocation that the elements are to be regarded as the
        body and blood of Christ, capable of communicating remission of sins.
        If, therefore, according to him, there is any offering up of our
        Lord, it must be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">with</span></em> the oblation of the material
        elements, to render that thank-offering acceptable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is
        another reading<a id="noteref_411" name="noteref_411" href=
        "#note_411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">411</span></span></a> which
        is more consonant with other passages, and therefore probably to be
        preferred; viz. that which represents <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189"
        id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Word”</span> as the Mediator
        or Propitiation <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">through</span></em> whom the oblation is made.
        We have that idea distinctly expressed in a former passage<a id=
        "noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href="#note_412"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a>, in
        which he speaks, in reference to this very text of Malachi, of the
        Church as offering <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">through</span></em> Jesus Christ; and it is
        implied in the Fragment, in which he speaks of our offering these
        things <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">with remembrance</span></em> (ἐν τῇ ἀναμνήσει)
        of the Lord<a id="noteref_413" name="noteref_413" href=
        "#note_413"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">413</span></span></a>.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But whichever
        reading we take, there is no foundation for the idea of a
        propitiatory sacrifice of Christ under the figure and appearance of
        the consecrated elements.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both this latter
        quotation from the <span class="tei tei-q">“<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Heresies</span></span>”</span> and the Fragment
        are opposed to the notion of any substantial change in the elements.
        The former speaks of the bread after consecration as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“not common bread,”</span> implying that it is still
        bread, although <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg
        190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        adapted to a sacred and mysterious use; and as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“consisting of two things, an earthly and a
        heavenly<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href=

        (meaning probably the elements themselves and the body and blood of
        Christ), whereas the notion of transubstantiation requires that there
        should be nothing of the earthly really left after the consecration.
        The fragment still more explicitly calls them <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">figures</span></em>
        at the very time that we partake of them. It is true that the view of
        Irenæus differs equally from ordinary Protestant notions, and indeed
        is more positive than that of the English Church; but we are to bear
        in mind that the Fathers did not always speak with logical accuracy.
        Their language has been brought forward in support of the theory of
        transubstantiation, and therefore it has become necessary to show
        that they did not write on that theory. It is not equally requisite
        that we should be able to construct a theory which shall explain all
        the figurative and imaginative language in which they expressed their
        faith in the real presence of Christ in the Sacrament. Irenæus
        certainly taught this doctrine, and that is enough for us of the
        Church of England, who do not concern ourselves to explain the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">manner</span></em> of his presence. Some of us
        may agree with his manner of expressing it, but we do not require of
        others that they should agree with him.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"

        "#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a>. But
        all these may be reconciled, if we consider them to be allusions to
        various portions of the consecration prayer. There is such a form
        left in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Apostolical Constitutions</span></span>, with
        which all the four ancient liturgies exhibited by Brett and Palmer
        coincide, viz. the Roman, the Oriental, the Egyptian, and the
        Gallican. Now all these forms contain a recital of the words of
        institution, which may not unfitly be called <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the word of
        God</span></em>, and an invocation of God to send down his Holy
        Spirit upon the gifts, to consecrate them to be the body and blood of
        Christ, which may be called either <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an invocation of
        God</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">an invocation of the Holy Ghost</span></em>. Is
        it not therefore most probable that Irenæus alludes to this prayer,
        which must have been used in very early ages, for its leading
        features to be found thus spread throughout the world? The
        expressions, therefore, which he uses, though various and distinct,
        are not contrary or contradictory: they allude to various portions of
        the same form.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg
        192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is worthy of
        observation, however, that this attributing of the consecration to
        these different things is contrary to the modern doctrine of
        transubstantiation, which attributes it to one and one only, viz. the
        recital of the words of institution: <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">This is my body, This
        is my blood</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is another
        passage which proves that no transubstantiation was then thought of;
        viz. the fragment<a id="noteref_418" name="noteref_418" href=
        "#note_418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">418</span></span></a>, which
        appears likely to have been a part of the account of the persecutions
        at Lyons. We there read that the heathen tortured the slaves of some
        Christians, in order to extort from them something which might serve
        as a colour for the severities they exercised upon them; and that the
        slaves, <span class="tei tei-q">“not knowing what to say to please
        their tormentors, except what they had heard from their masters, that
        the Holy Communion was the blood and body of Christ, and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thinking</span></em>
        that it was really flesh and blood, told this to those who were
        questioning them.”</span> Now it appears very clear that language
        such as this could scarcely have been used by a person who thought
        that the sacred elements had become really flesh and blood, which is
        the doctrine of transubstantiation; although it might be employed
        with perfect consistency by those who believed in a real mysterious
        presence of them in the Holy Communion, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> without any change in the nature of the
        elements.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Massuet<a id=
        "noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href="#note_419"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a> brings
        forward, in support of the doctrine of transubstantiation, the fact
        that the Marcosians pretended, by magical rites, to effect a change
        of the wine into blood. As they professed to produce a substantial
        change, he infers that the Church must have really produced such a
        change. But the inference is far from being a sound one; for as
        magical rites are invented to pander to the appetite of the ignorant
        for something supernatural, so it is most probable that a pretender
        of this description, who wished to set up for something superior to
        the clergy, should profess to do something <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more</span></em>
        wonderful than they; that whereas they effected none but a mystical
        change, he should pretend to a literal one. And this no doubt is the
        history of transubstantiation. It is the attempt of unspiritual minds
        to raise the wonder of the sacred mysteries to the highest pitch,
        forgetful meanwhile of the spiritual objects of them. The doctrine is
        eminently a carnal doctrine.</p>

        Justification.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those scholastical
        discussions on the nature of justification with which we have become
        familiar had not arisen when Irenæus wrote, and consequently we
        cannot expect him to speak with the precision to which we are
        accustomed. Still there are some principal points upon which, simply
        following the Scriptures, he is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">practically</span></em> clear.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He teaches, for
        instance, that men are not justified in themselves, but by the coming
        of Christ<a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href=
        "#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "#note_421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">421</span></span></a>; whence
        we may fairly conclude that he would place the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">meritorious
        cause</span></em> of justification in Christ: and as he connects
        justification with remission of sins<a id="noteref_422" name=
        "noteref_422" href="#note_422"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        remission of sins with the cross and death of Christ<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">423</span></span></a>, he
        would no doubt trace our justification to the death of Christ on the
        cross.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the same
        general manner he teaches that faith justifies man<a id="noteref_424"
        name="noteref_424" href="#note_424"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        speaking particularly of Abraham, to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> whom he attributes faith in Christ. He appears
        likewise to express faith, in another passage, by attending to the
        light of Christ<a id="noteref_425" name="noteref_425" href=
        "#note_425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">425</span></span></a>; but as
        the passage does not exist in the Greek, we cannot be quite certain
        what is its real meaning. Now although he says here that faith
        justifies, and elsewhere that our faith is our own<a id="noteref_426"
        name="noteref_426" href="#note_426"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">426</span></span></a>,
        because it springs from our own will and choice, yet it is plain,
        from the previous paragraph, that he simply means that faith is the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">qualification</span></em> for justification.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, where
        Irenæus says that man is justified by the moral law, which those who
        were justified by faith before the giving of the Law observed<a id=

        again, quoting the text: <span class="tei tei-q">“Offer unto God the
        sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows unto the Most High; and call
        upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou
        shalt glorify me;”</span> declares that God rejected the sacrifices
        and ceremonies by which the Jews thought to obtain remission of sins,
        and taught them these things (contained <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> in that text) by which man is justified, and
        draws nigh to God<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href=
        "#note_428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a>: in
        these passages Irenæus no doubt intends to say nothing more or less
        than St. James does where he declares that man is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">justified by
        works</span></em>. If any one regards Irenæus as contradicting the
        true doctrine of justification by faith, he must conceive that St.
        James equally contradicts it; and the same considerations which
        explain St. James will equally explain Irenæus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I may remark,
        moreover, in a matter confessedly not admitting of absolute
        demonstration, that Irenæus appears to use justification in what is
        commonly called the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">forensic</span></em> sense, and as taking its
        date from the act of the soul, by which it receives and embraces the

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> if we could be sure of the punctuation,
        but unhappily Ruffinus pointed it differently from all the MSS. of
        Eusebius and, I believe, Nicephorus: for he introduces a stop after
        τεσσαράκοντα, which makes Irenæus distinctly affirm that in his time
        some fasted forty <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">days</span></em>, whereas the common reading
        makes them fast only forty successive <em class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
        impossible to do <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">justice</span></em> to the subject without
        entering fully into the arguments on both sides; and therefore I will
        confine myself to an observation or two on the text of Irenæus. Let
        us then look at the passage according to the two methods of
        punctuation; and we shall find Irenæus affirming according to
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">one</span></em> that those who fasted any number
        of days, from one to forty, reckoned the hours both of day and of
        night into their day; or according to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the other</span></em>
        that some fasted one day, some two, some more; and that some reckoned
        forty hours of day and night into their day. Now that any persons
        could fast forty successive days, both day and night, abstaining from
        food all the time, cannot be imagined: and if they did not abstain
        from food all the time of their fast, the mention of its continuance
        day and night would be unmeaning.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this argument
        the reply of Beveridge, as may be seen in note 3, is, that no fast
        was kept strictly throughout the twenty-four hours by <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">total</span></em>
        abstinence from food: and he quotes the 50th Canon of Laodicea
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207"
        id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to show that the Lent fast was
        nothing more than abstaining from flesh, &amp;c. and living upon dry
        food. But, with deference to so great a name, this is but begging the
        question. The Canon of Laodicea only shows what <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Church
        required</span></em>, not what individuals practised. And Grabe<a id=
        "noteref_456" name="noteref_456" href="#note_456"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a> (on
        this passage) has proved that there were anciently two kinds of
        strict fasts observed in the last week of Lent; one of abstinence
        from all food till the evening, and then eating nothing but bread and
        salt accompanied with pure water; the other, practised by the more
        zealous, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">holding over</span></em> one, two, three, four,
        or six days, till the cock-crowing on Easterday. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Both Grabe and Bingham<a id="noteref_457"
        name="noteref_457" href="#note_457"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a> agree
        (what indeed appears self-evident) that there is no meaning in words,
        if these persons did not remain in total abstinence during this whole
        time; for what extraordinary zeal could there be in their practice,
        if they broke their fast in the evening, as others did.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, on the other
        hand, we suppose the fast to have been one of forty <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">hours</span></em>,
        commencing from the hour in which Jesus gave up the ghost, and
        terminating with that of his resurrection, there is then a sufficient
        reason for mentioning that the fast continued day and night; it
        becomes a thing within the reach of probability; and the period is a
        very natural one for those persons to choose who felt themselves
        equal to it. At the time in which the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Apostolical
        Constitutions</span></span> were written, it was enjoined on
        Christians<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href=
        "#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a> to fast
        the Friday and Saturday, if possible; if not, at least on the
        Saturday: and in either case it appears that they were not to break
        their fast till the first cock-crowing; i. e. in all probability, on
        Easter day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Leaving, then,
        other sources of controversy on <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> either side, the text itself appears to supply
        the strongest evidence in favour of the punctuation of the MSS. How
        that of Ruffinus arose, we are not absolutely concerned to say: but
        when the practice of the more lengthened fast had become established
        in the Church, it might easily lead to understanding the words of
        Irenæus in such a manner as to give it primitive authority.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But even supposing
        the fast of forty <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">days</span></em> to have been kept by <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em>
        persons in the age of St. Ignatius, this does not prove that practice
        to have originated in the apostles, as Irenæus gives equally high
        authority for the shorter fasts of one, two, or several days. All,
        therefore, that would be proved by the language of Irenæus (taking it
        in this sense) is that in the time of Ignatius a fast was kept before
        Easter, and that Christians were left to their own discretion as to
        the length of it. Chrysostom indeed expressly says<a id="noteref_459"
        name="noteref_459" href="#note_459"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a>, that
        the fast of forty days was not ordained <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> until the mass of Christians had come to
        communicate only on Easter day, and that without suitable devotion,
        and that the fast and other devotional exercises were appointed, to
        prepare them for the Communion on Easter day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Very little more
        remains to be observed under this head.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Irenæus likewise
        is, I believe, the first writer who uses the term παροικία to signify
        the district under the superintendence of a bishop<a id="noteref_460"
        name="noteref_460" href="#note_460"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">460</span></span></a>. And it
        is interesting that the selfsame term which we now use to distinguish
        ourselves from separatists was in use in his age, namely, that of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Churchmen</span></em><a id="noteref_461" name=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">461</span></span></a>. And
        that was perfectly natural, for the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Church</span></em>
        had a name from the beginning, but its attribute of <em class=

        distinguished from the confined locality of schisms and heresies, was
        not observed till afterwards; and therefore the name of <em class=

        was posterior to that of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the
        greatest difficulties to modern readers in the history of the
        primitive Church is the state of feeling and opinion on the subject
        of the Sabbath. We have been in the habit of arguing from the
        primitive institution of a holy day (which we have called a sabbath),
        and of viewing the Lord's day as answering to it; and if we may judge
        by the language of the earliest writers, they did not consider the
        Lord's day as intended to be a sabbath in itself, although some of
        them regarded it as being appointed instead of the Sabbath<a id=
        "noteref_462" name="noteref_462" href="#note_462"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a>.
        Irenæus certainly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg
        212]</span><a name="Pg212" id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        viewed the institution of the Sabbath as entirely Mosaical, and
        thought that Abraham and the patriarchs before the Law did not keep
        it<a id="noteref_463" name="noteref_463" href=
        "#note_463"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">463</span></span></a>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must not,
        however, be thence hastily concluded that he believed that Abraham
        and the patriarchs knew nothing of the seventh day as a day of divine
        worship. The primary and leading idea of a <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sabbath</span></em>,
        properly so called, is (not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">holiness</span></em> but) <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rest</span></em>;
        that is, abstinence from any employment that can be construed into
        labour. Now Irenæus might very well deny that the Patriarchs kept a
        day of rest from all employment, without in any degree intending to
        deny that they devoted the seventh day especially to religious
        worship.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An illustration of
        my meaning will be found in the admission of Justin Martyr, that
        Christians did not keep the Sabbath<a id="noteref_464" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        coupled with the well-ascertained fact<a id="noteref_465" name=
        "noteref_465" href="#note_465"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        very large proportion of them <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> indeed were in the habit of attending divine
        service on the seventh day. Perhaps a still closer illustration is
        seen in the Canons of the Council of Laodicea, which expressly forbid
        Christians to keep the Sabbath like Jews<a id="noteref_466" name=
        "noteref_466" href="#note_466"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">466</span></span></a>, and at
        the same time direct the Eucharistic offering to be made on that day
        as well as on the Lord's day<a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467"
        href="#note_467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">467</span></span></a>. If
        then many of the early Christians devoted a portion of the Saturday
        statedly to public religious exercises, and yet did not consider
        themselves as keeping a sabbath, it would be very unsafe to infer
        from the assertion that the Patriarchs did not keep the Sabbath, that
        therefore they had no day of religious worship. In fact it seems
        scarcely possible that the division and numbering of the days by
        sevens could have been kept up, as we know it was<a id="noteref_468"
        name="noteref_468" href="#note_468"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        the giving of the Law, without some religious observance connected
        with it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although, then,
        Irenæus did not regard the Mosaical Sabbath as being observed before
        the giving of the Law, and consequently regarded it as abolished with
        the Law, yet as he has asserted that the moral <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> law or decalogue was observed before
        Moses, and implies that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a>, it is
        very certain that he must have conceived the fourth commandment to be
        in some sense or other a directory to Christians: and it may
        therefore be inquired what he conceived ought to be learnt from it.
        This may in some degree be gathered from his saying that the Sabbath,
        like the whole Jewish Law, was symbolical, and that it was intended
        to teach men to serve God every day, and to typify the kingdom of
        God, when whosoever has persevered in godliness shall partake of his
        table<a id="noteref_470" name="noteref_470" href=

        regarded our Lord's apparent relaxation of the stringency of the

        appear from these passages that Irenæus was not in the habit of
        regarding the Christian practice of hallowing the Lord's day as the
        explicit fulfilment of the fourth commandment. He lived so near the
        apostolical times that he no doubt observed it in obedience to
        Christ's institution, without considering whether it was contemplated

        "Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> original institution
        of a holy day or not. But in common with other Christian writers, he
        did not think that the fulfilment of the fourth commandment lay in
        devoting any particular portion of time to the service of God; but in
        serving him continually as much as possible; and therefore, as a
        matter of course, in observing those times of sacred repose and
        divine worship which either the institution of Christ, or the common
        custom of Christians, or the rules of the Church, might have
        appointed<a id="noteref_474" name="noteref_474" href=
        "#note_474"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218"
        id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> According to such a feeling,
        therefore, whilst <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">no</span></em> particular portion of time would
        be kept with Jewish superstition, as though it were an end of itself,
        whatever time was kept would be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">so</span></em> kept as to ensure the ends
        proposed by its observance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And, if we revert
        to what has been before observed as to Irenæus's view of the law of
        liberty, we shall see that he would be so far from supposing that
        this Christian freedom authorized us to dispense with devoting one
        day in seven to God's service, that he would feel that it ought to
        lead those who had it in their power to devote even a larger portion.
        And such in fact was the practice of the Christians of those times.
        They assembled together not only on the morning and evening of the
        Sunday, but also throughout the east on the morning and evening of
        Saturday, and on the morning of Wednesday and Friday. When,
        therefore, there was so much zeal for the service of God, and the
        commandment was kept so amply in its spirit without thinking of the
        letter of it,—the warm feeling of Christians making them a law to
        themselves,—there was nothing to lead them to inquire critically how
        much the commandment actually required of them; and to have
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219"
        id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> instituted such an inquiry
        would have appeared like putting a restriction upon the ardour of
        Christian love, and returning to the spirit of the Law of Moses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The true question,
        then, to ask is, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">not</span></em> why the first Christians did not
        put the Lord's day upon the footing of the paradisiacal sabbath,
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">but</span></em> why we are <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">called
        upon</span></em> to do so in these latter days? And the true answer
        will be found in the fact that the great body of us have abused the
        law of liberty, as the Israelites of old had done, and therefore,
        like them, have need, in the providential dealings of God, to be put
        back under rules and restrictions again, until we are become fitted
        to act as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">children</span></em> of God: and when we are so,
        we have no wish to shake off such restrictions, but of our own accord
        go beyond them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In connection with
        this subject it is very remarkable that the Church of England in her
        catechism has not thought proper to connect the Lord's day in
        particular with the fourth commandment; although most of our writers
        for the last three hundred years have found it necessary so to do. It
        is true that we have done no more than our duty by pointing out to
        our people that God from the beginning has hallowed one day in seven,
        in order to prevent them from relapsing into absolute heathenism;—the
        error has been that we have too much omitted to show <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that this was the least he would be
        satisfied with. We have too much written as though those who fully
        observed one day in seven had done their duty, instead of leading
        them to feel that they cannot be possessed of the spirit of true
        Christian obedience so long as they confine themselves to the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

        Interpretation Of Scripture.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The writers of the
        primitive Church, taking the lead from the inspired writers, and
        probably preserving in many cases the traditional interpretations of
        the Apostles, were in the habit of seeing types in many things which
        to us appear to have none but a literal meaning. It is, however,
        certain that there was a great tendency amongst the Hellenistic Jews
        to make the whole of the Old Testament typical; and no doubt some
        Christians early followed them, as the Epistle of Barnabas and the
        Shepherd of Hermas (which were early writings, whether spurious or
        not) abundantly show: and this tendency continued to increase until
        the time of Origen, by whom it was pushed to such extremes, that,
        from that time, it became less popular.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Irenæus, however,
        is far from being a fanciful writer, and was more directly connected
        with the Apostles than most of the Fathers, and therefore the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222"
        id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> types which he recognises are
        worthy of much more attention than those of Origen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With him, then,

        type of Christ, though in what way we are not told, probably in the
        same sense as Abel; Moses was a type of him when he spread forth his
        hands, and by that sign conquered Amalek<a id="noteref_477" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were other
        points in which Moses was a type of Christ. <span class=

        fatness. For since that Christ, who was born according to the flesh,
        was to be sought out for destruction, and to be delivered in Egypt,
        that is, amongst the Gentiles, to sanctify the infants there, whence
        also he made a Church there; (for Egypt was from the beginning a
        gentile nation, as was also Æthiopia;) for this reason by the
        marriage of Moses was shown the marriage of the Word, and by the
        Æthiopian wife the Gentile Church is pointed out: and those who speak
        against it, and inveigh against and deride it, shall not be clean;

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He declares that
        the re-appearance of justification by faith, after it had been for
        some time cast out of sight by the Law of Moses, was typified by the
        circumstances of the birth of the sons of Thamar. For as Zarah put
        forth his hand first, and had the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        gave way to his brother Pharez, and thus was born after him; by this
        the Scripture declared <span class="tei tei-q">“that people which has
        the scarlet sign, viz. faith in uncircumcision, which was shown first
        in the patriarchs, and afterwards withdrawn when its brother was
        born; and that in consequence that which was first was born second,
        being known by the scarlet mark upon it, which is the suffering of
        the Just One, foreshown in Abel, written by the Prophets, and
        accomplished in the last times in the Son of God<a id="noteref_480"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Irenæus was of
        opinion that some of the apparent misdeeds of the old Patriarchs were
        not really sins, but circumstances brought upon them by divine
        Providence, with some mystical and typical end. Thus the cohabitation
        of Lot and his daughters is with <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">St. Paul has
        taught us that Jacob and Esau were types of the elder and younger
        Churches; but Irenæus has much amplified the figure, and brought in
        other parallelisms. <span class="tei tei-q">“And if any one would
        study the acts of Jacob, he will find them not empty, but full of

        was called Jacob, that is, the supplanter; holding and not holden;
        fettering but not fettered; struggling and conquering; holding in his
        hand the heel of his adversary, i. e. the victory: to this end was
        the Lord born, whose birth he typified, concerning whom John saith in
        the Revelation, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        the whole blessing; and for this reason the latter people stole from
        the Father the blessing of the former people, as Jacob took away the
        blessing from Esau. For which cause his brother suffered from the
        lying in wait and persecutions of a brother, as also the Church

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Persons sometimes
        ask, What is the advantage of studying the Fathers? why cannot we be
        contented with the light of Scripture? Those who study them reply,
        that one use at least is, that by their help the obscure parts of
        Scripture, where some truths are but hinted at or supposed, are
        brought forth into light and clear outline.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">An instance of
        this, and a very unobjectionable one, is to be found in the doctrine
        of Irenæus, and not of him alone, as to the intermediate state. We
        know from Scripture that there is an unseen state to which Christ
        descended<a id="noteref_492" name="noteref_492" href=

        "#note_494"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a>. If the
        parable of the rich man and Lazarus is taken literally, it seems to
        be implied that the good and bad are <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> separated in that state, and yet that they are
        capable of holding intercourse with each other; and there seems to be
        a hint that the state of the dead is, in some sense, a state of
        confinement<a id="noteref_495" name="noteref_495" href=
        "#note_495"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a>. Beyond
        this we have little, if any thing.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our views,
        however, such as they are, become confirmed and acquire definiteness,
        as we find the same subjects treated of or alluded to by Irenæus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He treats the
        parable I have spoken of, as not strictly a parable, but a relation

        asserts that it shows us that the soul, in a state of separation from
        the body, retains its individuality, so that disembodied souls may
        know each other, and hold mutual intercourse; and that each class of
        persons has its appropriate habitation even before the day of

        235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Christ observed the law of the dead, and departed into the midst of
        the shadow of death, where the souls of the dead were. And
        conformably he teaches us that the souls of his disciples will at
        death depart into the invisible place destined for them by God, and
        there remain, waiting for the resurrection<a id="noteref_498" name=

        believed that the souls of the just, although in death and consequent
        condemnation, would retain the Spirit of God, and consequently the
        seed and pledge of a new life<a id="noteref_501" name="noteref_501"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is another
        branch of this subject; viz. the employment of our Saviour while in
        the intermediate state. Irenæus thought, as did other Fathers, that
        our Lord went and preached the Gospel to those who were dead, there
        being forgiveness to whosoever would believe in him, so preaching to
        them; and that those who in old times had hoped in him, and foretold
        his coming, did then believe in him and obtain remission<a id=

        a definite meaning given to passages of Holy Writ, respecting which
        we may discuss and have discussed endlessly, resting in the mere
        light of Scripture. And that being the case, it appears more rational
        to accept the interpretation furnished by early writers, who are in
        all probability in this and other cases giving us views which had

        of the Gnostics that the Tempter was either the same as the God of
        the Old Testament, acting in opposition to the Supreme Being, or a
        creature and agent of this God. In contradiction to this notion,
        Irenæus lays down, and confirms from various portions of Scripture,
        that he was one of the angels, attendants upon the Supreme Being, who
        rebelled against him, who consummated his rebellion by seducing man
        from his allegiance, and who is always setting himself up as a rebel

        the Millennium are different from those which have prevailed
        subsequently, with almost universal consent in the Western Church,
        that portion of his Treatise is rarely found complete in our present

        ten parts, and the sudden coming of another power to their

        what he tells us on the subject of Antichrist; and he declares that
        when he has reigned, sitting in the temple of Jerusalem, for three

        introduce the times of the kingdom of heaven, and the true Sabbath,

        my purpose to enter into the probability or improbability of these

        with the Roman Empire in a state of division; and secondly, the

        the prophecy of Daniel (viii. 27) as signifying <em class=

        coupled with the literal interpretation of time in other passages;

        reign of Antichrist ceases, the undisputed reign of Christ (according
        to Irenæus) will begin, and will continue a thousand years. For as
        the days of creation were six, and the day of rest one; as moreover

        Mary.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are two
        passages of Irenæus, in which the name of the Blessed Virgin is
        introduced, which would not have called for any particular remark,
        were it not for the manner in which they are perverted by Romanist
        writers, and especially by the Benedictine editor, Massuet, in
        support of the blasphemous honour they bestow on her. When, however,
        we have examined them, we shall perceive that, although they may, no
        doubt, to those whose minds are imbued with superstitious prejudice,
        at first sight appear to countenance that prejudice, they do not
        really favour it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first of these
        passages affirms that <span class="tei tei-q">“as Eve, having Adam
        for her husband, but being still a virgin ... being disobedient,
        became both to herself and to the whole human race the cause of
        death; so also Mary, having her destined husband and yet <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a virgin, being obedient, became both to
        herself and to the whole human race the cause of salvation<a id=
        "noteref_532" name="noteref_532" href="#note_532"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">532</span></span></a>.”</span>
        There seems no difficulty in granting all this, and yet the
        conclusion by no means follows that the Blessed Virgin is to be
        regarded as a mediatrix and intercessor with God, next after her
        Son<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href=
        "#note_533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">533</span></span></a>. Eve
        was certainly the cause of death to the whole human race, because
        through her transgression Adam was made to transgress; and in him all
        mankind are made sinners. But it does not appear that original sin
        came to all mankind directly from Eve, or that she was any otherwise
        the cause of death to our race, except by bringing Adam into the
        transgression: otherwise we must suppose that our Lord, being born of
        a woman, must have inherited a sinful nature; for even Massuet does
        not make the Virgin sinless. As the transgression of Eve therefore,
        although <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg
        259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> no
        doubt her own act, was only instrumentally and indirectly the cause
        of our condemnation, so the obedience of the Virgin Mary, although
        her own act, was only instrumentally and indirectly the cause of our
        salvation, that is, by leading to the incarnation and birth of our
        Lord<a id="noteref_534" name="noteref_534" href=
        "#note_534"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">534</span></span></a>. And if
        so, there is no foundation whatever for making her a mediatrix and
        intercessor with God.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But still stronger
        reliance appears to be placed upon the next passage, in which the
        Virgin Mary is called <span class="tei tei-q">“the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">advocate</span></em>
        of the Virgin Eve<a id="noteref_535" name="noteref_535" href=
        "#note_535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">535</span></span></a>.”</span>
        And yet that very passage supplies a proof that this term cannot be
        taken otherwise than in a figurative and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> improper sense: for Irenæus therein asserts
        that <span class="tei tei-q">“as the human race was condemned to
        death through a virgin, so it is <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">saved</span></em>
        through a virgin;”</span> i. e. as he himself explains it, through
        her submission to the angelic announcement of the will of God, that
        his Son should be born of her. Now it would be clear blasphemy to
        ascribe our <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">salvation</span></em> to the Virgin otherwise
        than in a figurative sense, as being an instrument in the divine hand
        for its accomplishment by becoming the mother of the real Saviour;
        and so, in the same figurative sense she was the advocate of Eve, by
        becoming the mother of him who was really her advocate. The figure
        is, no doubt, rather bold, but still it is evidently but a
        figure.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
        interpretation indeed is so obvious, that to us, who have no such
        prejudices as the members of the Roman Church, it would have been
        unnecessary to insist upon it, were it not for the violent perversion
        of the passage by their writers. It is, perhaps, worthy of more
        distinct indication, that Irenæus, by declaring that the Blessed
        Virgin was the cause of salvation to <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">herself</span></em>,
        as well as to others<a id="noteref_536" name="noteref_536" href=
        "#note_536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">536</span></span></a>,
        directly contradicts the idea held by some in the Roman Church, (and
        I believe in the Greek likewise,) that she was entirely sinless. On
        the other <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg

          were ignorant of the Father: that they, not wishing to acknowledge
          any author of their existence, detained her, and subjected her to
          every kind of contumely, to prevent her return to the Father, and
          caused her to exist in this world in perpetual transmigration from
          one female form to another.</p>

          which she was held; and to rescue man by the knowledge of himself

          all actions were indifferent in their own nature, and that the will
          of the Creative Powers was the only thing which made one action
          more just than another. To do away with this tyranny, he declared
          that he had transformed himself first into a resemblance to the
          angels, then into that of man; in which latter form he had appeared
          in Judæa as the Son, and there apparently suffered; but only

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is obvious
          that such a scheme was adapted only to the gross and ignorant, with
          just enough of mysticism about it to enable its founder to keep up
          the character of a philosopher with the more refined, and enable
          him to pass off his lewdness as the result of a philosophical
          system, rather than the dominion of low propensities. The Emperor
          Claudius, notorious as a man of weak intellect, was an extremely
          likely person to be both amused and duped by his magical
          performances.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have here the
          germ of all the Antinomian heresies from that time to the present.
          However they may have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          minds, they all originate with persons of impure and unbridled
          propensities, who are unwilling to avow the real grossness of their
          characters, and therefore set up for some deeper knowledge or more
          subtle system than ordinary men.</p>

          subject is so well taken up by the late Dr. E. Burton, in the 42nd
          note to his Bampton Lectures, that I do not purpose to enter into
          it here, further than to remark that Irenæus ought not to be
          regarded as merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">following</span></em> Justin: for he himself
          had visited Rome, and was therefore likely to have informed himself
          personally upon a subject which he thought sufficiently important
          to bring forward in controversy.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is likewise a
          fact deserving notice, that the first instance we have of the
          worship of images amongst persons recognizing in any degree the
          gospel, is to be found amongst the followers of Simon Magus.
          Something of this kind probably suggested St. John's caution:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Little children, keep yourselves from

          informs us that he was one of the seven deacons, which some have

          all the information he gives respecting them leads to the
          conclusion that they had nothing in common with them, except their
          schism. He expressly states that they believed differently from the
          Gnostics, and agreed with Christians as to the creation of the
          world; and that they differed from Cerinthus and Carpocrates on the

          indeed implies that Ebion denied this latter fact; and Eusebius
          distinctly asserts of the great body of his followers, that they

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The succession
          of heresy, unlike that of the Church, had not for its object the
          keeping up of one uniform system of doctrine, but the exhibition of
          something sufficiently attractive or striking to prevent the minds
          of men from dwelling upon the truth. It required <em class=

          remarkable for ability of some kind or another. A successor was
          therefore provided to Simon in the person of <span class=

          whose great qualification was, that he equalled or excelled his

          Heresy, likewise, not requiring to be uniform, permitted its
          successive teachers to improve upon the system of their
          predecessors; and by this means both satisfied the natural love of
          mankind for novelty, and kept up the appetite. So Menander differed
          a little from Simon, at least in expression, in saying that the
          Supreme Essence was unknown to all men. He likewise introduced
          another <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">name</span></em> from the Gospel, representing
          himself, not as the Supreme <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Being, either personally or by direct
          emanation and operation, (as Simon did,) but as the Saviour,
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">sent</span></em> by the unseen Powers for the
          salvation of man. He likewise taught his followers, that by the
          magical practices in which he instructed them, they might even
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">vanquish</span></em> the Angelic Creators of
          this lower world, which was somewhat more than Simon promised.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It appears
          likewise that he initiated his followers by <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">baptism</span></em>, which he represented as
          the true and only resurrection, and taught them to believe that

          he got over the fact that they did both, we are not informed: but
          this making baptism the same thing as the resurrection, explains
          St. Paul's words<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href=

          where he represents some as teaching that <span class=

          Philetus, who spread this error in all probability in Asia Minor,

          Antioch, teaching the same general doctrine as his preceptor

          of whom was the God of the Jews; and he introduced one of the
          remaining angels, who had not been concerned in the creation, under
          the name of Satan, as the opponent of the Creators, and more
          especially of the God of the Jews<a id="noteref_564" name=

          represented the creation of man as having taken place at the
          suggestion of the Supreme Power, who exhibited to the angels a
          bright image of himself; which, as he immediately drew it up again
          to himself, they endeavoured to copy, and thus made man <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after its image and
          likeness</span></em>: but not having the power to make him erect,
          he would have grovelled on the earth like a worm, had not the
          Supreme Power, taking compassion on this poor copy of himself, sent
          forth into it a spark of life, which gave it limbs and an erect

          an unaccountable inconsistency, however, (for having a system to

          last and lowest is the one which we see; the Creators of which made
          this world, and divided its parts and nations amongst them. In this
          division the Jewish nation came to the share of the Prince of the
          Angels; and as he wished to bring all other nations into subjection
          to his favourite nation, the other angelic Princes and their
          nations resisted him and his nation<a id="noteref_576" name=

          Supreme Father, seeing this state of things, sent his
          first-begotten Mind, who is also called Christ, to deliver those
          who should believe in him from the power of the Creators. He
          accordingly appeared to mankind as a man, and wrought mighty deeds.
          He did not, however, really suffer, but changed forms with Simon of
          Cyrene, and stood by laughing whilst Simon suffered; and
          afterwards, being himself incorporeal, ascended into heaven.
          Building upon this transformation, Basilides taught his disciples
          that they might at all times deny him that was crucified, and that
          they alone who did so understood the providential dealings of the
          Most High, and by that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          Saturninus, however, but in other words, he asserted that the soul
          alone was capable of salvation, but the body necessarily
          perishable<a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He taught,
          moreover, that they who knew his whole system, and could recount

          could pass through and see them, without being seen in return: that
          they ought likewise to keep themselves individually and personally
          unknown to common men, and even to deny that they are what they
          are; that they should assert themselves to be neither Jews nor

          that the latter flourished in the last years of St. John, it
          appears most probable that Carpocrates was, if any thing, earlier
          than Basilides, and more properly coeval with Menander. In favour

          teaching the doctrine of the transmigration of souls, and adapted
          it to the support of profligacy, by asserting that every soul is
          destined to become acquainted with every kind of action, and that

          with the serpent, who from the earthly angels begat seven sons, in

          degraded condition. Knowing, however, that the debasement was only
          temporary, they complied with their condition, ate and drank, and
          begat Cain and Abel, of whom Cain, being seized on by the serpent,
          fell into folly and presumption, envy and murder. After this, by

          Abraham, however, and the Jews were the chosen people of

          them their virtue, so that all the supernal light with which they

          showed how wisely the Church had acted in rejecting him, by giving

          explaining the origin of evil consistently with holding the
          perfection of God. He was thence led to make matter co-eval with

          arise from that portion of matter which he left untouched in the
          work of creation, as unfit for his use. This idea he doubtless
          borrowed from the Platonic philosophy: but how from this he passed
          into the absurdities of Gnosticism we are not informed. We only
          learn from Irenæus that he fashioned them into a new system. It is
          curious, however, that he is said by his followers to have derived

          had attained such a degree of notoriety before the year 142, in
          which Justin Martyr offered his First Apology to Antoninus Pius,
          that Justin therein speaks of having written that book against all
          the heresies<a id="noteref_644" name="noteref_644" href=

          places his coming to Rome in the year 141, or third of Antoninus,
          or that of Eutychius, favoured by Bishop Pearson<a id="noteref_648"

          makes Hyginus contemporary with Adrian, this would equally agree
          with Justin having already written against him in 142: for he made
          himself known in his own country as an opposer of the truth before
          he came to Rome<a id="noteref_649" name="noteref_649" href=

          Whatever may be thought of the precise year at which he came to
          that city, he remained there fifteen or twenty years, for he
          continued to the episcopate of Anicetus, and retained some
          character for piety and correctness of faith up to that
          period<a id="noteref_650" name="noteref_650" href=

          Thenceforward, however, he cast off all such pretensions, and
          retiring to Cyprus, taught without disguise all the impieties his

          happened that Irenæus did not write directly against him, but
          against his followers: and as every disciple held himself capable
          of improving upon the system of his instructor, that which the
          Bishop of Lyons gives in full detail differs in some particulars
          from that taught by Valentinus himself. <span class="tei tei-pb"

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">652</span></span></a>: but
          still Ptolemy had some peculiarities of his own<a id="noteref_653"
          name="noteref_653" href="#note_653"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Irenæus has preserved to us the leading features of the scheme as
          taught by Valentinus, and by their help, and that of a fragment
          preserved by Epiphanius<a id="noteref_654" name="noteref_654" href=
          "#note_654"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">654</span></span></a>,
          which corresponds with what Irenæus has told us, (although Bishop
          Pearson rightly contends that it is not the work of the heretical
          leader himself). I will endeavour to place it before my
          readers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Valentinus then
          taught, according to Irenæus, that all things sprung from one
          primeval pair, the Ineffable and Silence<a id="noteref_655" name=
          "noteref_655" href="#note_655"><span class=

          latter being according to the fragment the Thought of the former or
          his Grace, but called Silence more correctly, because she
          accomplished every thing by simple <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">desire</span></em>
          without utterance. From these, according to Valentinus, sprung
          another pair, the Father<a id="noteref_656" name="noteref_656"
          href="#note_656"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">656</span></span></a> and
          the Truth: the former of whom the fragment makes to emanate from
          the Unbegotten Original and Silence, by her <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page296">[pg 296]</span><a name="Pg296" id="Pg296"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> desire; the latter from herself and the
          Father, by some mysterious union of the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">lights</span></em>
          from each; so that their offspring was a <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em>
          image of herself and thence derived her name. Truth, therefore, by
          a like mysterious union with her Father, produces a tetrad of two
          pairs, the Word and the Life, Man and the Church. Subsequently the
          Holy Spirit was sent forth either by the Truth or by the Church,
          (for upon that point the Old Translator of Irenæus and Epiphanius
          differ,) to examine the Æons, and to make them fruitful in the
          produce of truth<a id="noteref_657" name="noteref_657" href=
          "#note_657"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far Irenæus

          from this point there appears nothing more in common, and as
          henceforth there is a general coincidence between Valentinus and
          his followers, I shall give the scheme as it appears in the first
          book of Irenæus, mentioning the variations where they occur.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be
          however proper to notice this radical difference between the
          heresiarch and his disciples, that he considered all these Æons, as

          affections, and motions of the one unseen, infinite <span class=

          mentioned tetrad then, knowing themselves to have been sent forth
          to the glory of the unbegotten Father, desired to glorify him by
          their own act. Wherefore the Word and the Truth sent forth ten
          Æons, called the Profound and Mixture, the Ever-youthful and Union,
          the Self-existent and Pleasure, the Immoveable and Commixture, the
          Only-begotten and the Blessed: whilst Man and the Church sent forth

          Maternal and Charity, Aïnus (the Eternal Mind, or as it is in the

          be explained by his saying that they were not, like him, real
          beings, but merely qualities or emanations. Irenæus was probably
          the first person who published their names: for the Valentinians
          prided themselves on their being a secret, hidden from all but the
          initiated. The names, however, were differently stated by later

          venturesome curiosity, reached forth into the fathomless height and
          depth, in a state of extreme excitement and anxiety, and would have
          been reabsorbed into the original substance, but for the
          interposition of a power called the Barrier, which prevented her
          farther progress, and brought her back to herself; but at the same
          time kept up a perpetual separation between her and the Father, to
          which she originally belonged<a id="noteref_665" name="noteref_665"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Valentinus then
          taught that Wisdom, being thus separated from Theletos, became the
          mother of the Christ, producing him from the remembrance of the
          better things or superior beings she had left, but with a kind of
          shadow attached to him, derived from her fallen condition; and by
          that means emptied herself of her spiritual substance. Whereupon
          he, having become possessed of it, cut off from him the shadow, and
          returned aloft into the Fulness, leaving his mother under the
          shadow he rejected. In this still more degraded condition,
          Valentinus makes her to have produced a son, who became the
          Creator, and whom he regards as complete ruler of all things
          subordinate to him<a id="noteref_666" name="noteref_666" href=

          however, improved, as they thought, upon this part of his scheme.
          They personified the longing of Wisdom, making it her offspring,

          to prevent another commotion amongst the Æons, by the will of the
          Supreme Father, the Mind or Only-begotten produced another pair,
          the Christ and the Holy Spirit; the former of whom gave them fully
          to understand that it was impossible to comprehend the First Cause,
          but that what could be comprehended of him was revealed in the

          they were reduced to a state of repose, and betook themselves to
          magnify the Great First Father. In token whereof they all united to
          produce one perfect being, Jesus, called also the Saviour, the

          personal Barrier, the Σταυρὸς or Stake. But the Christ took pity on
          her, and reaching forth over the Barrier, (διὰ τοῦ Σταυροῦ
          ἐπεκταθεὶς, a strange perversion and accommodation of evangelical
          expressions to their system,) gave her a <em class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most
          remarkable feature in the scheme of Valentinus was his treatment of
          the Scriptures. He did not, like some of his predecessors, speak
          with contempt of them, as having proceeded from an imperfect Being.
          He did not like others reject the whole New Testament, as a figment
          of the <span class="tei tei-q">“natural men,”</span> as they called
          the orthodox, and substitute apocryphal writings in their place:
          nor did he again, like others, reject such portions of the
          Scriptures as militated strongly against their views. He professed
          to receive the whole of the Gospels and Apostolical <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> writings, but he accommodated the
          Scripture to his views. Tertullian indeed<a id="noteref_690" name=

          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">690</span></span></a> uses
          very different terms; viz. that he did not accommodate the
          Scripture to his views, but his views to the Scripture. It was
          certainly his endeavour to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">appear</span></em> so to do; and accordingly
          he adopted Scripture <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">language</span></em> to a very great extent,
          and no doubt professed, like all modern teachers of false doctrine,
          to find all his doctrine in the Scripture: so that I believe we
          have only one instance of his reading a passage differently from
          the Church<a id="noteref_691" name="noteref_691" href=
          "#note_691"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          Indeed he reproached the orthodox for not having preserved the true
          meaning: or rather looked down upon them as being naturally
          incapable of receiving it; being not spiritual, but natural and
          carnal.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was, no
          doubt, in this way that he kept up that character for faith and
          piety, of which Epiphanius speaks, and to which Tertullian
          alludes<a id="noteref_692" name="noteref_692" href=

          Irenæus has given us numerous instances in which he and his

          they will be found to be either forced accommodations of numbers
          and names, or violent perversions of the letter of Scripture, or

          interpretations put upon it in such a way as that it may almost be
          made to mean anything. The success of such interpretations was of
          course aided by the equally unnatural accommodations of Scripture
          customary with the orthodox, at least those of the Alexandrian
          school. There are, likewise, some fragments of his preserved by
          Clement of Alexandria<a id="noteref_694" name="noteref_694" href=

          inn or caravanserai defiled by travellers, appears at first sight
          so unobjectionable, that, out of the connection in which it stands,
          one should hardly suspect any evil meaning. It is however intended
          to teach the Gnostic tenet, that the heart of the spiritual man is
          no more a partaker of the evil wrought in it by evil spirits, than
          a caravanserai in the nuisances committed by every wanton
          traveller. This is evidently another, and a less offensive way of
          stating that to the spiritual mind no passion can communicate any
          permanent pollution, and that the elect are not to be called to
          account for what they fall into in this world: and its
          inoffensiveness at first sight is no bad illustration of the habit

          (properly speaking) to the First Cause, but in calling him Μονότης,
          and his companion Ἐνότης, which may perhaps be rendered Soleness
          and Unity. These, he said, constituted only one being. This
          duopersonal Being produced, without separation from himself, a
          beginning of all things, comprehensible, but unbegotten and
          invisible, called the Monad, and with him another power denominated
          the One. This was his first tetrad; but in the rest he does not
          appear to have differed from the other Valentinians<a id=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> he states at length, and which I have

          Epiphanius indeed, quoting Irenæus<a id="noteref_705" name=
          "noteref_705" href="#note_705"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          makes him say that this heretic and his disciples ascribed two
          wives to Bythus, Thought and Will, from whom he made the rest of
          the Æons to proceed. But it is evident from the version of the
          Ancient Interpreter that the actual words of Irenæus were Οἱ περὶ
          Πτολεμαῦον, which may mean either Ptolemy or his followers, and as
          Tertullian ascribes this tenet to his disciples, desirous of
          improving upon their master, we may safely conclude that Epiphanius
          does not intend to attribute it distinctly to Ptolemy, but either
          to him or to his followers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the followers

          supplied that defect, nor is there any contradictory statement on
          the subject. He taught that the first ogdoad of Æons did not spring
          successively one pair from another, but that the first four after
          the First Cause and his Thought were created at once when the
          Forefather determined upon giving forth some being, that became the
          Father; as what he emitted was true, it was called the Truth: when

          manifest himself, then came Man; and those whom he then foresaw

          speaks of him in the same terms, we may safely take that as the
          sense of Irenæus. We find him first in Asia Minor, recompensing the
          hospitality of a deacon with whom he lodged by corrupting his wife,
          who for a good while followed him, but was at length brought back
          to the Church by the perseverance of the Christians<a id=

          Where his subsequent residence was we do not learn. The
          circumstance which brought him more particularly under the notice
          of Irenæus was that his opinions and the consequent depravity of
          morals had spread to the neighbourhood of Lyons<a id="noteref_712"
          name="noteref_712" href="#note_712"><span class=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">712</span></span></a>. The
          practical mischief appears first to have attracted his attention,
          and he was thence led to inquire into the speculative system which
          produced such fruits. Both the one and the other shall be noticed
          in their order.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The scheme
          differed in reality very little in its <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> frame-work from that of Valentinus, Ptolemy,
          and Colorbasus; the latter of whom Irenæus represents him as more
          particularly agreeing with<a id="noteref_713" name="noteref_713"
          href="#note_713"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">713</span></span></a>; but
          it was differently dressed up. Instead of making the Fulness a
          system of personal beings or emanations, he made it the <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">name</span></em> of
          the Great First Cause, consisting of thirty letters, instead of as
          many Æons, divided into four syllables, of which the two first
          consisted of four letters each, the third of ten, and the fourth of
          twelve. This name originated in the wish of the Great Father to
          reveal himself. He therefore opened his mouth, and spoke a Word
          like himself, which was Ἀρχὴ, the Beginning; (this was the first
          syllable;) then a second, a third, and a fourth. What the three
          latter are we are not told: but they have continued to sound on
          from that day to the present, and will continue so to do, until
          they all unite in sounding forth together the same letter, when the
          consummation of all things will take place. About this matter,
          however, there is some obscurity, the passage not being very
          intelligible<a id="noteref_714" name="noteref_714" href=
          "#note_714"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
          tedious beyond measure to enter into the application of this
          particular notion to the general Gnostic scheme: but he held a
          particular doctrine in regard to Jesus, which it will be proper to
          mention. He thought that he was the joint production <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Man and the Church, the Word and
          Life; but that in producing him the angel Gabriel took the place of
          the Word, the Holy Spirit of Life, the Power of the Most High of
          Man, and the Virgin Mary of the Church: that the Supreme Father
          chose him in the womb to manifest himself in him by means of the
          Word, who therefore descended upon him at his baptism in the form
          of a dove<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href=
          "#note_715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I come now to
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">practice</span></em> of Marcus. He openly
          pretended supernatural powers, communicated to him by a familiar
          spirit, which he flattered his followers, chiefly women, by
          professing to communicate to them<a id="noteref_716" name=
          "noteref_716" href="#note_716"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a>. The
          Eucharist he found especially suited to his purpose, and was the
          first apparently who taught any thing like transubstantiation. He
          used, like the Church, wine mingled with water, but pretended to
          bring down into it by his prayers, the blood of the supernal Grace;
          and accordingly, lengthening out his devotion, that the chemical
          agents, which he doubtless employed, might have time to act, he at
          length produced the liquid, of a much deeper colour than when he
          began his incantations. In another of his tricks he gave his female
          friends a part. He requested one of them to take the mingled cup,
          and to offer the prayer of benediction; whereupon he poured the
          contents of it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg
          314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          into a much larger cup, which he himself held, which, as he
          pronounced the mystical blessing upon the woman he employed,
          gradually became full with the contents of the smaller, and at
          length overflowed<a id="noteref_717" name="noteref_717" href=
          "#note_717"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">717</span></span></a>. This
          again was, in all probability, effected by some chemical agent,
          deposited in the bottom of the larger cup, and producing a gradual
          effervescence: but in those days of ignorance it stamped the worker
          of such wonders as something more than ordinary man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In
          communicating, as he pretended, to his devotees a portion of the
          grace he possessed, he purposely contrived, in the most subtle
          manner, to inflame their sensual desires, and to direct them
          towards himself, without using a single word or act to which he
          could not immediately give a mystical meaning; so that, if his
          wishes did not succeed, there was nothing with which he could be
          charged, without subjecting the person who so charged him to the
          imputation of having put an unholy meaning upon holy things. And if
          they did succeed, the victim, if not conscience-seared, would feel
          self-corrupted and self-betrayed. In this way he became master, not
          only of the persons, but also of the substance of many women of
          wealth and station<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href=
          "#note_718"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">718</span></span></a>. To
          make his arts, however, the more successful, he administered
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name=
          "Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to them inflammatory

          still more to guard himself from their defection, under the terror
          of conscience, and the dread of future judgment, he taught them a
          form of words, to be addressed to their mother Achamoth, whom he
          represents as seated with God on his throne, by means of which they
          would be rendered invisible to the Judge, and pass unhurt to their
          heavenly spouses the angels<a id="noteref_720" name="noteref_720"

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such a scheme as
          this was too palatable to human nature not to have many followers;
          and accordingly it found its way to Lyons, where Irenæus was
          bishop. The exact nature of it was first learnt by the confessions
          of his victims and those of his followers, when, recovering from
          their delusion, they wished to be readmitted to the Church. One
          particular instance I have already mentioned, of his having seduced
          the wife of a deacon in Asia Minor, with whom he had lodged. This
          person remained with him for a long time; but, being at length
          restored by the unwearied efforts of the Christians, spent the rest
          of her life bewailing the pollution she had sustained. This was not

          Redemption.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is one
          feature of the Gnostic scheme common to almost every variety of the
          Gnostics, which was reserved for a separate detail; and which
          Irenæus introduces immediately after the account of the Marcosian
          heresy, having probably been able to obtain a more perfect account
          of their views on that subject, than of those of any other sect.
          That feature is their ordinance of <span class=

          without denying baptism, threw it into the back ground, and thus

          professed object of this rite was the regeneration of those who

          celebrated it as a marriage; others made it a baptism in water,
          with varying forms of words<a id="noteref_727" name="noteref_727"

          others again poured a mixture of oil and water upon the head of the
          person who received it; whilst some declared, that the blessing
          being purely spiritual, all outward signs were unavailing and
          impertinent; that knowledge was in fact redemption, and that those,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In most cases
          the Redemption was effected during the lifetime of those who were

          <span style="font-size: 144%">Section IX. Reflections Upon
          Gnosticism.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gnosticism is
          now well-nigh forgotten, or noticed only by those who are led to an
          acquaintance with it either by its connexion with certain passages
          in the New Testament, or by a systematic study of the early Fathers
          of the Church. And yet it existed in the world, and spread over the
          civilized portions of it as a system of philosophy at a time when
          heathen speculation had attained its highest refinement, and
          Christianity had introduced certainty to take the <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> place of speculation. But that it
          should have taken hold on the minds of men to such an extent and at
          such a time, is surely one of the most unaccountable facts in the
          history of the human mind. To us, even the Platonic system would
          appear so much more rational and intelligible, and the Christian
          doctrine so much more simple and natural, and, if I may so say,
          manly, that in their presence one wonders what there could have
          been to recommend Gnosticism. The Grecian schemes were so many
          efforts of unassisted reason to find out truth by simple
          speculation. They could therefore never be propounded as
          certainties, but only as probabilities. They accordingly rested on
          their probability, and struck out many truths. They bear about them
          the air of the conclusions of men searching after truth, and having
          in some degree attained it. Christianity, on the other hand,
          professed to be a revelation from above. It did not pretend to
          speculate or to reason; it taught its doctrines as infallible
          truths, and supported its teaching by miracles, and an appeal to
          fulfilled prophecy. Gnosticism was like neither. It was in fact
          gratuitous speculation, founded upon nothing but the fact of a
          great difficulty, which human reason had never yet solved, the
          causation of evil; but it claimed no support from reason; it
          propounded no proofs; but put itself forward as the revealed
          solution of this difficulty. It wrought miracles, indeed, which
          might have served where the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Christian miracles were unknown, but poor and
          weak indeed to put in competition with them, for they were mere
          juggles. They answered no beneficial end; they were over in a few
          minutes; they submitted themselves to no daily and hourly proof;
          and although professing to support a higher and purer God than was
          ever before thought of, they were of the same nature as those
          practised by heathen sorcerers. But to have solved this great
          difficulty, the system ought at least to have been uniform, or at
          most progressive. No teacher should have contradicted another,
          however much he might improve upon him. And yet this was far from
          being the case. The various successive teachers not only pulled
          down what their predecessors had set up, but even contemporary
          leaders contradicted each other. This would have been perfectly
          consistent if they had set up as mere speculators; but they claimed
          a sort of inspiration; nay, whilst setting aside the Gospel, they
          claimed support from the Gospel; whilst making higher pretensions
          than they allowed the Apostles, they professed to have a tradition
          received from the Apostles; whilst utterly overthrowing the
          religion of Christ, they appealed to his words and teaching as
          supporting them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But although
          borrowing support from Christianity, it was not itself in any sense
          a religion. It taught no present devotion towards any superior
          being. It <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg
          320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          had no offerings, no prayers, still less any expiations. Although
          some of its teachers practised rites borrowed from the eucharist,
          they had no religious object. They were mere juggles. Although the
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">idea</span></em> of glorifying the beings
          above entered into the system, yet it affected only the beings
          above man, or man after he quitted this state. It had no place on
          earth. This was a place of discipline, or training, for a state in
          which he was to glorify the great First Cause; but he had nothing
          to do with glorifying him here. The great object of man here was
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em>. In this respect it was
          analogous to the Grecian philosophies; for they had no connection
          with religion, but were rather antagonists to it. They tended to
          overthrow the heathen superstitions, but they furnished nothing to
          replace them. They taught, it may be, moral duties; but it was not
          upon any principles of religion, but rather of social benefit. They
          attained to better notions on the unity and nature of God than were
          entertained by their compatriots, but they led not to a purer
          worship of him. At best they refined and mysticized the mythology
          and religious observances of the old religions. In this respect,
          then, of being unconnected with religion, it was like the
          philosophical systems of its own and former times; but it went
          further than they in being essentially <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">irreligious</span></em>, by placing the
          perfection of man in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">knowledge</span></em>, and that only. By this
          means the necessity of religion of any kind was totally done
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name=
          "Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> away. Curiosity was
          substituted for devotion, and unbounded liberty for duty, whether
          to God or to man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Curiosity being
          thus canonized, it is remarkable that the Gnostic system had baits
          for almost every description of it. It is curiosity, the desire of
          knowing what others know, fully as much as passion and appetite,
          which leads men into the various descriptions of vice; and this
          species of curiosity was not only allowed, but even sanctioned and
          stimulated. Men were told that it was the express destiny of every
          one who was to be perfect, to know everything that could be known
          in this world; and not only that, but that if a person failed of
          acquiring the requisite knowledge in one lifetime, his soul must
          pass into another and another body, until it had arrived at the
          necessary degree of information. It is true that this implied, in
          its literal meaning, the knowledge of good as well as of evil. But
          it requires little acquaintance with human nature to tell us in
          what sense it would be most commonly taken. And if any scruples
          still remained, they were removed by the doctrine that all actions
          were naturally indifferent, and that nothing but human opinion, or
          the arbitrary will of a tyrannical being, the Jewish God, had ever
          made any such thing as moral distinctions. Thus a vicious curiosity
          became a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">duty</span></em>, if such a term had been
          allowable in Gnosticism; or, at all <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> events, that man who did not foster and
          indulge it to the utmost, was fighting against his own
          interest.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is another
          kind of curiosity, which has governed many in all ages, and which
          is not even yet extinct, and that is, a desire to be acquainted
          with future or unknown circumstances, or to possess a power beyond
          the reach of ordinary men. There have been always those who have
          professed themselves possessors of this supernatural knowledge, and
          of course others who have desired either to possess it or to
          witness and profit by its exercise. From this desire has arisen the
          whole of magic from the beginning, and the science of astrology in
          particular. Accordingly, this was a marked feature in many of the
          Gnostic teachers, that they laid claim to magical powers; and
          herein they differed from the heathen philosophers, and became the
          antagonists of the Christian apostles. Simon Magus, for instance,
          who is generally reckoned the first Gnostic leader, was a magician,
          and there is great reason to suspect that his faith was more a
          reliance on the Apostles, on the supposition of their having some
          deeper art than his own, than the faith of the heart in the
          principles of the Gospel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is
          another class of persons who could neither be imposed on by the
          pretensions to supernatural power, nor the seductions of evil
          appetites, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page323">[pg
          323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          whose cast of character is altogether intellectual, and whose
          temptations must therefore be intellectual. The attention of such
          persons had in all ages been directed to the unseen things of
          creation, the invisible springs of all earthly motions and actions,
          the secret agencies of nature, the nature of the Great Original of
          all things, the methods of his providential government, the time
          and manner of the creation, the origin of evil, the future state of
          mankind after their departure from this earthly scene. Questions of
          this kind had engaged the curiosity of minds of the higher order
          ever since civilization began, and no system could find acceptance
          with them which offered no solution of such questions. Gnosticism
          accordingly furnished food for the curiosity of these, and that in
          greater abundance than any other system yet invented.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
          Gentile speculatists, there was also the philosophical Jew, who had
          become acquainted with the Grecian learning, and had thus come to
          endeavour to account, upon new principles, for the economy of the
          divine government under the law; partly for his own satisfaction,
          partly to render it palatable to his heathen friends. Two points in
          his law would present difficulty: first, the endless forms and
          ceremonies considered with reference to God, who, being a spirit,
          would require a spiritual worship, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> (for this is a truth which this class of Jews
          were fully sensible of,) together with the prohibitions of various
          animals; and secondly, the severities which God himself exercised
          and taught their forefathers to exercise against idolaters. And no
          doubt many Jews of this class were become practically unbelievers
          by speculating upon points which their forefathers implicitly
          received and devoutly practised.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was again
          another class; viz. Christians by birth and education, brought up
          in leisure, and given to study, who, never having received the
          Gospel humbly and practically, became infected with the unsettled
          spirit of speculative inquiry. These would see the apparent
          incongruities between the law and the Gospel, especially in the
          spirit in which each was administered; and instead of being
          contented to be ignorant of that which had not been revealed, would
          endeavour to form some system independent of revelation, by which
          to account for these incongruities. To these two classes we shall
          see that Gnosticism also adapted itself; and indeed to the latter
          it would be specially adapted in the licentiousness of its morals.
          For being brought up without their own choice in a system of great
          strictness, at which their nature perhaps rebelled, and which they
          had themselves never heartily embraced; and yet not liking to
          renounce it on the distinct avowal <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of a love of vice, they would gladly close
          with a scheme which gave unbounded license the character of
          superior wisdom, and even of duty itself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We see then what
          there was in the character of the times to prepare men for such a
          system as Gnosticism. But it did not grow up at once into all its
          completeness. It developed itself by degrees, as men were prepared
          for it; and when we have considered it in its leading features, we
          can scarcely fail to acquiesce in the view of it taken by the
          Christian writers contemporary with it; viz. that it was a scheme
          specially concocted by the author of evil, as antagonist to
          Christianity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Simon Magus, as
          all agree, was the first teacher of Gnosticism; and when he first
          appeared in that character in Samaria, it is obvious that he could
          have known but little of the Gospel, and this may account for the
          little notice taken of it in his system. He came as the great power
          of God, that is, as God manifested on earth; and he wrought
          pretended miracles in confirmation of his pretensions. It is
          remarkable that none of his successors made any such pretension as
          this, although they too, at least some of them, professed
          miraculous power. He was therefore the antagonist of Christ;
          strictly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Antichrist</span></em>, in a higher sense than
          any other. He taught that the God of the Jews was not truly God,
          but only, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg
          326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          like the Jupiter of heathenism, one of a set of angelic powers;
          that the Supreme God had nothing to do with the origination of evil
          further than that he had created those angelic powers from whom it
          had sprung; nay, that he had not created them directly, but by his
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">thought</span></em>, which, taking a personal
          character, was the actual Creator of these; that therefore the
          Supreme Being had nothing to do with anything in this world,
          excepting in so far as he had interfered to remedy the mischief
          occasioned by the angels. It was in this way that he endeavoured to
          reconcile the imperfections of this world with the perfection of
          God. But he went further than this; for by making the Creator of
          this world and the God of the Old Testament an imperfect being, he
          in reality denied God, whilst professing to know more of him than
          other men.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This part of the
          system only accounted for physical evil, and such moral evils as
          oppression and violence: but moral evil, as we commonly understand
          it, he treated in quite a different way; i. e. by denying that it
          was evil at all; for he asserted that it was so only through the
          tyrannical imposition of the angels. Nay, he even went so far as to
          assert that he himself was God, come down from above to rescue men
          from their thraldom by teaching them the truth of things; and thus
          to restore them to their rightful liberty, by showing them that
          they might <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg
          327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          do whatever they listed, and indeed ought to do so to vindicate his
          authority, which had been usurped by the angels. A more plausible
          scheme of blasphemy and licentiousness could scarcely have been
          concocted for the philosophizing Jew, or the heathen who had looked
          into Judaism merely as a rival system of barbarian philosophy. It
          recognised all the facts of the Old Testament; but it totally
          neutralized them, and destroyed altogether the religion with which
          they would have appeared to be inseparably blended.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When
          Christianity began to spread, and Jesus was believed on by
          multitudes, and reverenced by many who did not receive him, it
          became politic to recognise the Gospel in the same manner in which
          the Law had been recognised. Accordingly, the external facts of the
          life of Jesus were not disputed, but a new spirit was given to
          them. Jesus was a manifestation of the Supreme God, as Simon was;
          come upon the same errand, to destroy the Jewish law; and thence an
          object of hatred to the Jews, who triumphed so far as to crucify
          the external body in which he appeared, but had no power over him
          who had inhabited it. Here there was just enough of truth to impose
          upon a person brought up to believe the Gospel without really
          loving it, and falsehood enough altogether to prevent its
          reception.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sketch which
          I have now traced is the nucleus <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of Gnosticism. Simon's dignifying his
          paramour with the title of the Thought of the First Cause, and his
          figment of her having been in a perpetual state of transmigration,
          was no doubt an after thought to cover the grossness which prying
          minds might fancy in the great empiric; an end which might not be
          sufficiently accomplished by his doctrine that all actions were
          indifferent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether Simon
          really invented the first ogdoad of pure emanations from the Great
          Father may be doubted; for the testimony to that fact does not
          appear sufficiently early, and those who assert it contradict each
          other in the names of them. But that he taught that there were
          Excellences and Powers, as well as angels, appears from Irenæus.
          Yet as that author undertakes to tell the share which Simon had in
          forming the system, and certainly attributes the regularity of it
          to his successors, it appears most probable that he defined nothing
          as to the number or functions of those celestial beings.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sketch,
          however, of Simon, to whatever extent he went, was sufficiently
          filled up by his successors. In his system of angelic beings they
          defined their number, and to a certain extent fixed their
          functions. There was at last a body of these formed between the
          Supreme Being and the authors of this world, perfect in holiness
          and obedience. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg
          329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          The defection of one of these was made as much as possible the work
          of accident. She was made, according to various schemes, sometimes
          to be totally excluded from this perfect society, sometimes to be
          restored to it again, leaving an imperfect offspring behind her.
          From her or her offspring, sprang the Creator, who is sometimes
          represented as the chief of seven angels, sometimes as a peculiar
          being having the angels under him. The creation of man is
          represented as the work of this imperfect being, but the spark of
          heavenly life in him as an emanation, more or less direct, from the
          First Cause. In this way the scheme became more definite; but from
          the same cause it became a set of schemes more or less inconsistent
          with each other, but all aiming at having a succession of mysteries
          to be communicated by degrees. In this way the minds of men were
          amused and tantalized, and prevented from a serious search after
          truth; whilst if one scheme was searched to the bottom, and its
          stock of mysteries exhausted, there was still another and another
          refinement to lure him away from the real truth. There was,
          however, the uniform tendency to remove the government of this
          world from the cognizance of the Supreme Being, and to represent
          the author of the law and the prophets as an imperfect,
          self-contradictory, cruel being. There was the same mode of
          rendering null the distinction between moral good and evil, by
          attributing it to opinion, or <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page330">[pg 330]</span><a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> custom, or the ordinance of the God of this
          world. There was the same attempt to nullify the Gospel, by doing
          away with the Christian idea of the incarnate Son of God, and
          representing the advent of Jesus as a portion of the Gnostic
          scheme. For whether Jesus was considered as only <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">apparently</span></em> a man, or as <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">merely</span></em>
          a man; whether the Saviour dwelt in him or made use of him; whether
          it were the Saviour, or the Christ, or the Only-begotten, or the
          Jesus above, who interested himself for the redemption of the
          spiritual seed, it all amounted to the same thing in the end. It
          abolished the real salvation of the soul; it took away the
          incarnation and atonement; it made the Gospel of no effect.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The nature of
          the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">redemption</span></em> it preached was
          likewise everywhere the same. It was not a redemption from the
          dominion of sin, but by denying that there was any such thing as
          sin. Whether it taught that the simple practical knowledge of this
          fact was all the redemption necessary, or that some initiatory rite
          was requisite to give that knowledge, or that a full knowledge of
          the Gnostic theory was to be superadded to qualify for <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eternal</span></em>
          redemption,—whether it led its votaries to defy the God of the Old
          Testament, or taught them mystic forms by which to elude him when
          sitting in judgment, it all amounted to the same thing. Lewdness of
          the grossest kind was denied to be any sin. There were,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name=
          "Pg331" id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> indeed, some who
          embraced the general theory, and with it believed that the flesh,
          as being the work of the Creator, was to be denied and mortified in
          every way, and who therefore decried marriage<a id="noteref_730"
          name="noteref_730" href="#note_730"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a>
          itself, and forbad to eat flesh; but they were the few. The
          opposite use of the undervaluing of the flesh was the more popular
          and the more prevalent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hitherto,
          perhaps, there has appeared but little in common with our own
          times; but there were other features of Gnosticism, in which it
          will appear to have been the parent of Antinomianism, even that of
          the most recent days. If any one is at all familiar with the high
          Calvinism of Toplady and his school, he will have found that it
          strongly resembled the Gnosticism of the age of Irenæus. It is of
          the essence of strict Calvinism to teach that <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">individuals</span></em> are <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">inevitably</span></em> destined to salvation;
          and so it was in Gnosticism. The spiritual seed must all be brought
          back again from earthly degradation; none can fail of being so,
          first or last. It may be destined to numerous transmigrations; but
          the spirit must finally be wafted upward to the eternal
          Fulness<a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href=
          "#note_731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a>.
          Again, the spiritual pride and presumption of the genuine
          Antinomian is a very observable trait: his speaking <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332" id="Pg332"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of all as carnal who do not adopt his
          scheme; his placing religion not in holiness, but in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">knowing</span></em>
          the truth; his assumption of superior illumination; his
          declarations that none but those specially favoured <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are
          capable</span></em> of knowing the truth; all this is merely a
          repetition of Gnosticism. The Gnostic called himself spiritual, and
          the Churchman carnal<a id="noteref_732" name="noteref_732" href=

          declared that none were capable of receiving his scheme but the

          to others good works were necessary and useful<a id="noteref_736"
          name="noteref_736" href="#note_736"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">736</span></span></a>, but
          that their lot, however praiseworthy, could never be the same as
          that of the elect<a id="noteref_737" name="noteref_737" href=
          "#note_737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">737</span></span></a>. So,
          again, the abuse of the doctrine of justification by faith is as
          early as those times. They declared that faith and love was the sum
          of their religion<a id="noteref_738" name="noteref_738" href=
          "#note_738"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">738</span></span></a>; that
          the law might be a restraint suited to inferior natures, but that
          to them it would be a degradation to submit their minds to its
          yoke; and that, in fact, whatever acts they might commit, it was
          impossible for them either to be polluted by those acts or to fail
          of salvation<a id="noteref_739" name="noteref_739" href=
          "#note_739"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">739</span></span></a>. Who
          would not suppose that the modern ultra-Calvinist was the speaker?
          So again, at that time, as in these days <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> these tenets were not always taken up as a
          cloak for licentiousness. Saturninus and Tatian were extremely
          correct in their lives; and Valentinus was not accused of any
          peculiar immorality: indeed, he long continued nominally a member
          of the Church, which, if his conduct had been flagitious, he could
          not have done. If they despised the restraints of the moral law,
          they probably supposed, like Toplady and others, that they had
          higher principles, which would lead them to greater heights of
          purity: or they were men of a speculative turn, who took up
          Gnosticism as a theory, without any disposition to make that
          practical use of it which others did, merely because they were not
          persons of warm passions. Indeed, if we may judge from a fragment
          preserved by Clement of Alexandria, Valentinus was rather a mystic
          in his religion<a id="noteref_740" name="noteref_740" href=
          "#note_740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">740</span></span></a>.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are two or
          three features in which the Gnostics were the forerunners of a very
          different class of errors. Transubstantiation no doubt arose in
          time by a natural depravation of the true doctrine of the
          Eucharist, through the desire of defining that which Scripture and
          primitive tradition had left undefined. But it is curious that a
          hint of it should have been struck out by Marcus, one of the
          magical Gnostics, who, amongst other arts of legerdemain,
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name=
          "Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hit upon the idea of
          bringing down into the wine and water <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the blood of the
          supernal grace</span></em>, by means of an invocation<a id=
          "noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href="#note_741"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">741</span></span></a>. It
          is equally curious to read in the account of Carpocrates and his
          disciples, that they asserted that Pilate had procured a likeness
          of Jesus Christ to be taken, and that they set his image amongst
          those of Pythagoras, and Plato, and Aristotle and the rest, and
          decked it with chaplets, and paid to it the selfsame honours which
          the heathen paid to their idols<a id="noteref_742" name=
          "noteref_742" href="#note_742"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">742</span></span></a>. Nor
          is it less remarkable that the Gnostics in general, when refuted by
          the Scriptures, should have spoken in disparagement of them (as I
          have already pointed out) in terms singularly corresponding with
          those sometimes made use of by Roman controversialists:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“They turn to accuse the Scriptures, as
          though they were not correct, nor of authority; and say that they
          are at variance with themselves, <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">neither can the
          truth be discovered from them by those who are ignorant
          of</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">743</span></span></a>.”</span>
          Coincidences of this kind are at least curious; and the further we
          search the more clearly will it appear that the germs of all
          subsequent errors appeared in very early times.</p>

          II. §. 53. Quisquis Irenæum Latinum cum Tertulliano contulerit, e
          vestigio deprehendet adeo hunc vestigia illius premere, adeo verbis
          ipsis, verborumque figuris et ordini adhærere, ut id unum sibi
          proposuisse videatur, paucioribus contrahere, iisdem sæpe servatis
          verbis, immixtis tamen pro more dicteriis, quæ ille fusioribus
          exsequutus est. Sic Irenæus, lib. I. cap. xi. n. 3. Epiphanis
          sententiam referens, scribit: <span class="tei tei-q">“Est quidem
          ante omnes Proarche, proanennoëtos, et inenarrabilis, et
          innominabilis, quam ego monotetem voco. Cum hac monotete est
          virtus, quam et ipsam voco henotetem. Hæc henotes et monotes, cum
          sint unum, emiserunt, cum nihil emiserint, principium omnium
          noeton, et agenneton, et aoraton, quam archem sermo monada vocat.
          Cum hac monade est virtus ejusdem substantiæ ei, quam et eam voco
          hen. Hæ autem virtutes, id est, monotes et henotes, et monas, et
          hen, emiserunt reliquas emissiones Æonum.”</span> Tertullianus vero
          cap. 37. <span class="tei tei-q">“Est,”</span> inquit, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“ante omnia Proarche, inexcogitabile et inenarrabile,
          quod ego nomino monoteta. Cum hac erat alia virtus, quam et ipsam
          appello henoteta. Monotes et henotes, id est, solitas et unitas,
          cum unum essent, protulerunt, non proferentes, initium omnium
          intellectuale, innascibile, invisibile, quod sermo monada vocavit.
          Huic adest consubstantiva virtus, quam appellat unio. Hæ igitur
          virtutes, solitas, singularitas, unitas, unio, cæteras prolationes
          Æonum propagarunt.”</span> Ubi eadem verba, (nisi quod Græca quædam
          Latine vertuntur,) eadem styli barbaries, atque apud Irenæi
          interpretem occurrunt. Hic n. 5. <span class="tei tei-q">“Alii
          rursus ipsorum primam et archegonon octonationem his nominibus
          nominaverunt: primum Proarchen, deinde Anennoëton, tertiam autem
          Arrheton, et quartam Aoraton. Et de prima quidem Proarche emissum
          esse primo et quinto loco Archen; ex Anennoëto secundo et sexto
          loco Acatalepton; et de Arrheto tertio et septimo loco Anonomaston;
          de Aorato autem quarto et octavo loco Agenneton.”</span>
          Tertullianus, cap. 25. totidem verbis: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Primo enim constituunt Proarchen, secundo Anennoëton,
          tertio Arrheton, quarto Aoraton. Ex Proarche itaque processisse
          primo et quinto loco Archen; ex Anennoëto, secundo et sexto loco
          Acatalepton; ex Arrheto, tertio et septimo loco Anonomaston; ex
          Invisibili, quarto et octavo loco Agenneton.”</span> Certe si e
          Græco immediate exscripsisset omnia hæc Tertullianus, tot nomina
          Græca Latine vertisset; nec fortuito et casu fieri potuit ut hoc
          illi cum Irenæi interprete convenerit. Hic cap. xii. n. 3.
          Colorbaseorum hypothesim sic exponit. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Quando cogitavit aliquid emittere Propator, hoc Pater
          vocatus est; at ubi quæ emisit, vera fuerunt, hoc Alethia vocatum
          est. Cum ergo voluit semetipsum ostendere, hoc Anthropos dictus
          est. Quos autem præcogitaverat posteaquam emisit, hoc Ecclesia
          vocata est. Loquutus est Anthropos Logon, hic est primogenitus
          Filius. Subsequitur autem Logon Zoe, et sic prima octonatio
          completa est.”</span> Ille cap. 36. <span class="tei tei-q">“Quum,
          inquiunt, cogitavit proferre, hoc Pater dictus est; quum protulit,
          quia vera protulit, hic Veritas appellata est. Quum semetipsum
          voluit probari, hoc Homo pronuntiatus est. Quos autem præcogitavit,
          cum protulit, tunc Ecclesia nuncupata est. Sonuit Homo Sermonem, et
          hic est primogenitus Filius: et Sermoni accessit Vita, et ogdoas
          prima conclusa est.”</span> Plura alia similia passim occurrunt
          apud Tertullianum. Sed quod demum ostendit hunc non e Græco, sed ex
          interprete Irenæi sumpsisse quæ refert, illud est, quod ubi lapsus
          est interpres Græca perperam reddens, lapsus est et Tertullianus.
          Ille, ut jam dixi, nomen Ἐπιφανὴς appellativum esse putans, male
          omnino vertit <span class="tei tei-q">“clarus.”</span> Tertullianus
          similiter errantem sequutus scripsit, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“insignior.”</span> Irenæus, cap. ii. n. 3. Sophiæ
          perturbationem enarrans, scribit eam, fœtum informem cum
          peperisset, <span class="tei tei-q">“primo quidem contristatam
          propter inconsummationem generationis, post deinde, φοβηθῆναι μὴ
          καὶ αὐτὸ τέλος ἔχῃ.”</span> Sic saltem legit interpres; vertit
          enim, <span class="tei tei-q">“timuisse ne hoc ipsum finem
          habeat;”</span> ubi τέλος <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“perfectionem,”</span> non <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“finem”</span> vertendum erat, ut in notis ad hunc
          locum diximus. Nec melius Tertullianus, cap. 10. <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“primo quidem contristari propter inconsummationem
          generationis, et metuere postremo, ne finis quoque
          insisteret.”</span> Ubi similiter τὸ ἀτελὲς τῆς γεννήσεως vertit
          <span class="tei tei-q">“inconsummationem generationis;”</span> et
          relicto Irenæo Græco, Latinum interpretem sequutus scripsit,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“ne quoque finis insisteret.”</span> Eodem
          cap. n. 4. refert Irenæus, quod Pater per Monogenem emiserit Horon
          in imagine sua, ἀσύζυγον, ἀθήλυντον: ubi interpres perperam legens
          ἀσυζύγῳ, ἀθηλύντῳ, vel, ut alii volunt, ἀῥῥενοθήλει, perperam et
          vertit, <span class="tei tei-q">“sine conjuge
          masculo-fœmina.”</span> Eadem culpa tenetur et Tertullianus, cap.
          cit. <span class="tei tei-q">“Pater per Monogenem Nun, quem supra
          diximus Horon, in hæc promit in imagine sua fœmina-mare.”</span>
          Nempe uterque id ad imaginem refert, quod Horo soli convenire posse
          recta ratio demonstrat. Culpam hanc non sustineret Tertullianus, si
          textum Græcum hic potius quam interpretem consuluisset. Paulo post,
          Sophian ab Horo mundatam et confirmatam, ac suæ restitutam
          conjugationi cum dixisset Irenæus, addit: Χωρισθείσης γὰρ τῆς
          ἐνθυμήσεως ἀπ᾽ αὐτῆς σὺν τῷ ἐπιγινομένῳ πάθει, αὐτὴν μὲν ἐντὸς
          Πληρώματος μεῖναι· τὴν δὲ ἐνθύμησιν αὐτῆς σὺν τῷ πάθει ὑπὸ τοῦ Ὅρου
          ἀφορισθῆναι καὶ ἀποσταυρωθῆναι. Quæ sic reddidit interpres:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Separata enim intentione ab ea, cum
          appendice passione, ipsam quidem infra Pleroma perseverasse:
          concupiscentiam vero ejus cum passione ab Horo separatam, et
          crucifixam, et extra cum factam esse, &amp;c.”</span> ubi duo
          peccat, primum quod, σὺν τῷ ἐπιγινομένῳ πάθει, vertit, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“cum appendice passione;”</span> vertendum erat,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“cum passione quæ supervenerat.”</span>
          Secundum, quod ἀποσταυρωθῆναι vertit, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“crucifixam;”</span> hic significat, quasi <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“vallo cinctam et disjunctam”</span> a Pleromate. Eadem
          omnino peccat et Tertullianus, scribens: <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Enthymesin ejus et illam appendicem passionem ab Horo
          relegatam et crucifixam.”</span> Hæc et plura alia, quæ identidem
          in notis observavi, invicte, ni fallor, probant, Tertullianum, ut
          Græcum Irenæum legerit, (quod non nego) ab eo tamen sæpe defecisse,
          ut Latini interpretis, et quidem interdum errantis, vestigia
          sectaretur.</dd>

          voluntarie emundari docuit. Quo facto, necesse fuit auferri quidem
          vincula servitutis, quibus jam homo assueverat, et sine vinculis
          sequi Deum; superextendi vero decreta libertatis, et augeri
          subjectionem quæ est ad regem, ut non retrorsus quis revertens,
          indignus appareat ei qui se liberavit: eam vero pietatem et
          obedientiam, quæ est erga patremfamilias, esse quidem eandem et
          servis et liberis; majorem autem fiduciam habere liberos, quoniam
          sit major et gloriosior operatio libertatis, quam ea quæ est in
          servitute obsequentia.—3. Hæc autem, quemadmodum prædiximus, non
          dissolventis erant Legem, sed adimplentis, et extendentis in nobis:
          tamquam si aliquis dicat, majorem libertatis operationem, et
          pleniorem erga Liberatorem nostrum infixam nobis subjectionem et
          affectionem. Non enim propter hoc liberavit nos, ut ab eo
          abscedamus; nec enim potest quisquam extra dominica constitutus
          bona, sibimetipsi acquirere salutis alimenta: sed ut plus gratiam
          ejus adepti, plus eum diligamus. Quanto autem plus eum dilexerimus,
          hoc majorem ab eo gloriam accipiemus, cum simus semper in conspectu
          Patris.</dd>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“Quoties volui colligere filios tuos, et
          noluisti?”</span> veterem legem libertatis hominis manifestavit:
          quia liberum eum Deus fecit ab initio, habentem suam potestatem,
          sicut et suam animam, ad utendum sententia Dei voluntarie, et non
          coactum a Deo. Βία enim Θεῷ οὐ πρόσεστιν· ἀγαθὴ δὲ γνώμη πάντοτε
          συμπάρεστιν αὐτῷ. Et propter hoc consilium quidem bonum dat
          omnibus. Posuit autem in homine potestatem electionis, quemadmodum
          et in angelis (etenim angeli rationabiles); uti hi quidem qui
          obedissent, juste bonum sint possidentes, datum quidem a Deo,
          servatum vero ab ipsis. Qui autem non obedierunt, juste non
          invenientur cum bono, et meritam pœnam percipient: quoniam Deus
          quidem dedit benigne bonum, ipsi vero non custodierunt diligenter
          illud, neque pretiosum arbitrati sunt, sed supereminentiam
          bonitatis contempserunt. Abjicientes igitur bonum, et quasi
          respuentes, merito omnes justum judicium incident Dei.... Dedit
          ergo Deus bonum, ... et qui operantur quidem illud, gloriam et
          honorem percipient, quoniam operati sunt bonum, cum possint non
          operari illud; hi autem qui illud non operantur, judicium justum
          excipient Dei, quoniam non sunt operati bonum, cum possint operari
          illud.—2. Εἰ φύσει οἱ μὲν φαῦλοι, οἱ δὲ ἀγαθοὶ γεγόνασιν, οὐθ᾽
          οὗτοι ἐπαινετοὶ, ὄντες ἀγαθοὶ, τοιοῦτοι γὰρ κατεσκευάσθησαν· οὐτ᾽
          ἐκεῖνοι μεμπτοὶ, οὕτως γεγονότες. Ἀλλ᾽ ἐπειδὴ οἱ πάντες τῆς αὐτῆς
          εἰσι φύσεως, δυνάμενοί τε κατασχεῖν κὶι πρᾶξαι τὸ ἀγαθὸν, καὶ
          δυνάμενοι πάλιν ἀποβαλεῖν αὐτὸ, καὶ μὴ ποιῆσαι· δικαίως καὶ παρ᾽
          ἀνθρώποις τοῖς εὐνομουμένοις, καὶ πολὺ πρότερον παρὰ Θεῷ, οἱ μὲν
          ἐπαινοῦνται καὶ ἀξίας τυγχάνουσι μαρτυρίας, τῆς τοῦ καλοῦ καθόλου
          ἐκλογῆς καὶ ἐπιμονῆς· οἱ δὲ καταιτιῶνται καὶ ἀξίας τυγχάνουσι
          ζημίας, τῆς τοῦ καλοῦ καὶ ἀγαθοῦ ἀποβολῆς. καὶ διὰ τούτου οἱ
          προφῆται παρήνουν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις δικαιοπραγεῖν, καὶ τὸ ἀγαθὸν
          ἐξεργάζεσθαι· ... ὡς ἐφ᾽ ἡμῖν ὄντος τοῦ τοιούτου, καὶ διὰ τὴν
          πολλὴν ἀμέλειαν εἰς λήθην ἐκπεπτωκότων, καὶ γνώμης δεομένων ἀγαθῆς,
          ἣν ὁ ἀγαθὸς Θεὸς παρέσχε γινώσκειν διὰ τῶν προφητῶν.—3. Ταῦτα γὰρ
          πάντα τὸ αὐτεξούσιον ἐπιδείκνυσι τοῦ ἀνθρώπου, καὶ τὸ
          συμβουλευτικὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ, ... ἀποτρέποντος μὲν τοῦ ἀπειθεῖν αὐτῷ,
          ἀλλὰ μὴ βιαζομένου.—5. Et non tantum in operibus, sed etiam in fide
          liberum et suæ potestatis arbitrium hominis servavit Dominus,
          dicens: <span class="tei tei-q">“Secundum fidem tuam fiat

          suam habet sententiam. Et iterum: <span class="tei tei-q">“Omnia
          possibilia sunt credenti;”</span> et, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Vade, sicut credidisti, fiat tibi.”</span> Et omnia
          talia suæ potestatis secundum fidem ostendunt hominem. Et propter
          hoc is <span class="tei tei-q">“qui credit ei, habet vitam æternam;
          qui autem non credit Filio, non habet vitam æternam, sed ira Dei
          manebit super ipsum.”</span>——V. xxvii. 1. Si ergo adventus Filii
          super omnes quidem similiter advenit, judicialis est autem, et
          discretor credentium et non credentium, quoniam ex sua sententia
          credentes faciunt ejus voluntatem, et ex sua sententia credentes
          faciunt ejus voluntatem, et ex sua sententia indictoaudientes non
          accedunt ad ejus doctrinam: manifestum, quoniam et Pater ejus omnes
          quidem similiter fecit, propriam sententiam unumquemque habentem,
          et sensum liberum; respicit autem omnia, et providet omnibus,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“solem suum oriri faciens super malos et

            usus est Valesius, eodem modo, quo nos jam transcripsimus, legunt
            atque interpungunt.... Et huic quidem lectioni favit Σύνοψις τῆς
            εὐαγγελικῆς ἱστορίας, in quam Beatus Rhenanus in præf. ad
            Ruffinum se incidisse refert, ubi hæc Irenæi verba sic citantur,
            seu potius explicantur: Οἱ μὲν γὰρ μίαν μόνον ἡμέραν ἐνήστευον,
            οἱ δὲ δύο, οἱ δὲ πλείονας· οἱ δὲ μʹ ὥρας μόνας ἡμερινὰς καὶ

            est a doctissimo nostro Petro Gunning jam episcopo Cicestriensi
            in appendice ad tractatum de paschali jejunio. Verum multa sunt
            quæ huic lectioni refragantur. Ut alia omittam, quis miri hujus
            jejunii quadraginta horis commensurati, e veteribus præsertim,
            meminit? Quadraginta dierum jejunio nihil in antiquis
            scriptoribus frequentius occurrit; at de quadraginta horarum
            jejunio altum iis silentium. Porro aliud quoque in his verbis,
            sic interpunctis, æque si non magis inauditum observare licet,
            <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quadraginta horis
            diurnis ac nocturnis commensuratum</span></em>. Quo nihil
            absurdius excogitari potest: ac proinde Valesius pro ἡμέραν
            substituendum putat νηστείαν, ut non dies, sed jejunium
            quadraginta horis commensuretur. Hanc autem violenter introductam
            verborum commutationem contra unanimem omnium codicum consensum
            docti nunquam admittent; præcipue cum e verbis ipsis, ut in
            omnibus codicibus leguntur, et in nonnullis distinguuntur, verior
            et ecclesiæ primitivæ ritibus magis consonus sensus elucescat:
            nimirum Johannes Christophorsonus et Henricus Savilius hunc
            Irenæi locum sic distinxerunt; ... τεσσαράκοντα. ὥρας τε ἡμερινὰς
            καὶ νυκτερινὰς συμμετροῦσι τὴν ἡμέραν αὐτῶν. Sic etiam legit et
            distinxit olim Ruffinus, qui sic vertit: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“Quidam enim putant uno tantum die observari debere
            jejunium, alii duobus, alii vero pluribus, nonnulli etiam
            quadraginta; ita ut horas diurnas nocturnasque computantes diem
            statuant.”</span> Quibus verbis nihil aliud indigitatur, quam
            quod hi uno, illi duobus, alii pluribus, nonnulli etiam
            quadraginta diebus jejunarunt; omnes autem unamquamque diem, quam
            jejunii peregerunt, per nocturnas æque ac diurnas horas emensi
            sunt; ut nulla hora vel diei vel noctis, usque ad numeri dierum,
            quos sibi constituerant, exitum, jejunium solverent. Contra hanc
            expositionem H. Valesius duo objicit: primo, quod hinc necessario
            consequetur, eos qui xl dies jejunabant, toto illo tempore nihil
            prorsus comedisse, quando quidem horas tam diurnas quam nocturnas
            jejunio deputabant. Respondeo, nihil minus quam hoc ex dicta
            expositione consequi: in jejuniis enim celebrandis, præsertim hoc
            paschali, non ab omni prorsus alimento, ut cuique notum est, sed
            a carnibus tantum vel aliis fortasse nonnullis ciborum generibus
            abstinebant; at reliquis vesci licebat. Hoc egregie confirmatur
            ex concil. Laod. can. 50, quo dicitur δεῖ πᾶσαν τὴν τεσσαρακοστὴν
            νηστεύειν ξηροφαγοῦντας. Hic enim per totam quadragesimam, ac
            proinde nocturnas æque ac diurnas horas, jejunare præcipitur; et
            tamen aridis vesci permittitur; vel potius per istius modi
            ξηροφαγίαν, sive aridorum esum, totum hoc quadragesimale jejunium
            celebrari constituitur. Alterum, quod objicit, est, quod cum
            Irenæus dixerit, alios uno die, alios biduo, alios vero pluribus
            diebus jejunare, quid necesse est addere alios 40 dies jejunare,
            cum in eo quod plures dies dixit, quadraginta satis
            comprehendantur. Respondeo, quod etiamsi nonnullos plures quam
            duos dies jejunare dixerat, non tamen superfluum erat, eorum
            etiam, qui xl dies jejunabant, mentionem facere. Cum enim a
            minimo jejunio, viz. unius diei, inceperit, quidni in maximum
            quoque expresse desineret, ut maximus viz. dierum numerus, quem
            quispiam in jejuniis observabat, æque ac minimus
            innotesceret?</p>

          quoniam eos qui similiter ut Abraham credebant ei, solvit et
          vivificavit, nihil extra Legem faciens, curans in die sabbatorum.
          Non enim prohibebat Lex curari homines sabbatis, quæ et
          circumcidebat eos in hac die, et pro populo jubebat ministeria
          Sacerdotibus perficere; sed et mutorum animalium curationem non
          prohibebat. Et Siloa etiam sæpe sabbatis curavit: et propter hoc
          assidebant ei multi die sabbatorum. Continere enim jubebat eos Lex
          ab omni opere servili, id est, ab omni avaritia, quæ per
          negotiationem, et reliquo terreno actu agitur: animæ autem opera,
          quæ fiunt per sententiam et sermones bonos, in auxilium eorum qui
          proximi sunt, adhortabatur fieri. Et propter hoc Dominus arguebat
          eos, qui injuste exprobrabant ei, quia sabbatis curabat. Non enim
          solvebat, sed adimplebat Legem, summi Sacerdotis operam perficiens,
          propitians pro hominibus Deum, et emundans leprosos, infirmos
          curans, et ipse moriens, uti exsiliatus homo exiret de
          condemnatione, et reverteretur intrepide ad suam hæreditatem.—3.
          Sed et esurientes accipere sabbatis escam ex his quæ adjacebant,
          non vetabat Lex: metere autem et colligere in horreum vetabat. Et
          ideo Dominus his, qui incusabant discipulos ejus, quoniam vellentes
          spicas manducabant, dixit: <span class="tei tei-q">“Nec hoc

          worship, and communion on that day, and affirms that our Lord, when
          he appeared to his disciples on Easter day, taught them to observe
          the day in this manner. Καὶ τῇ μετὰ τὴν Κρονικὴν, ἥτις ἐστιν Ἡλίου

          us that in his time the Lord's day appeared likely to be regarded
          as the proper sabbath.—Further on we find the Council of Laodicea
          (see p. <a href="#Pg213" class="tei tei-ref">213</a>, note 5)
          directing Christians to rest by preference on the Lord's day, and

          business, labour, and public sports were forbidden by public

          Christians themselves before their religion obtained the sanction

          de his qui sunt in eo decem Regibus, in quos dividetur quod nunc
          regnat imperium, significavit Joannes Domini discipulus in
          Apocalypsi, edisserens quæ fuerint decem cornua, quæ a Daniele visa
          sunt, dicens sic dictum esse sibi: <span class="tei tei-q">“Et
          decem cornua quæ vidisti decem Reges sunt, qui regnum nondum
          acceperunt, sed potestatem quasi reges una hora accipient cum
          bestia. Hi unam sententiam habent, et virtutem et potestatem suam
          bestiæ dant. Hi cum Agno pugnabunt, et Agnus vincet eos, quoniam
          Dominus Dominorum est, et Rex Regum.”</span> Manifestum est itaque,
          quoniam ex his tres interficiet ille qui venturus est, et reliqui
          subjicientur ei, et ipse octavus in eis; et vastabunt Babylonem, et
          comburent eam igni, et dabunt regnum suum bestiæ, et effugabunt
          Ecclesiam: post deinde ab adventu Domini nostri destruentur.
          Quoniam enim oportet dividi regnum, et sic deperire, Dominus ait:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Omne regnum divisum in se, desolabitur: et
          omnis civitas vel domus divisa in se, non stabit.”</span> Dividi
          igitur et regnum, et civitatem, et domum oportet in decem: et
          propterea jam partitionem et divisionem præfiguravit.</dd>

            ὁμολογεῖτε, καὶ συναχθήσεσθαι τὸν λαὸν ὑμῶν, καὶ εὐφρανθῆναι σὺν

            persons have supposed Justin in this last passage to assert, that
            orthodox Christians in general taught the doctrine of the
            personal reign, and thence have imagined a discrepancy between
            the latter statement and that immediately preceding: but a little
            attention will show, that all he asserts concerning orthodox
            Christians in general is, that they believe the resurrection of
            the flesh; and he further adds, that <em class=

          the (personal) Word of God (§ 8). Perhaps he may be thought to lean
          to Gnosticism where he says that the soul is naturally mortal, and

              Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
              electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
              computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new
              computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of
              volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Volunteers
              and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
              they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s goals
              and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain
              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
              Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a
              secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
              generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=
              "http://www.gutenberg.org/donate" class=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Please check
              the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
